However, reliable and extensively validated PGT-SR methods for selecting embryos without BCRs in large-cohort studies are lacking.MethodsIn this prospective, multicenter, cohort study, carriers with BCRs undergoing PGT-SR were recruited across 12 academic fertility centers within China. PGT-SR was performed using genome-wide SNP genotyping and haplotyping approach. Parental haplotypes were phased by available genotypes from a close relative or an unbalanced embryo. The karyotypes of embryos were inferred from the haplotypes. Only a single embryo was transferred in each cycle.FindingsBetween April 2018 and March 2023, 1298 carriers we randomly enrolled. A total of 7867 blastocysts from 1603 PGT-SR cycles were biopsied, in which 7750 (98.51%) were successfully genotyped and analyzed. Overall, 75.98% (1218/1603) of cycles obtained euploid embryos and 53.15% (852/1603) generated non-carrier embryos. The proportion of carrier and non-carrier embryos was similar in different subgroups. A total of 1030 non-carrier and 439 carrier embryos were transferred, 817 healthy babies were delivered cumulatively. Our results demonstrate that SNP-haplotyping method is highly accurate (sensitivity 95% CI: 98.34%\u2013100%, specificity 95% CI: 96.63%\u2013100%, respectively), and can be applied universally to different BCR types.

BCRs can cause infertility, miscarriages, and affected offspring, and conventional preimplantation genetic testing for structural rearrangements (PGT-SR) cannot distinguish embryos carrying balanced rearrangements from truly normal embryos, risking transmission of BCRs to offspring. Using SNP haplotyping, the study analyzed 7867 blastocysts, detecting 37.32% with rearrangement-related imbalances and 15.42% with de novo aneuploidies; 2676 embryos were euploid and further phased to classify 1367 non-carrier and 1307 carrier embryos, with no bias in distribution across rearrangement types. About 70% of BCRs were inherited from parents. Among 1469 transferred embryos (1030 non-carrier, 439 carrier), 921 clinical pregnancies and 817 live births occurred. The method showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing carrier vs. non-carrier embryos verified by prenatal or postnatal karyotyping. Notably, 73.07% of newborns had normal karyotypes, tripling the yield of normal offspring compared to expected 50%. Pregnancy and miscarriage rates were comparable between carrier and non-carrier embryo transfers. The study highlights SNP haplotyping as a universal, highly accurate approach to both detect chromosomal imbalances and select embryos without parental BCRs, reducing transmission risk and improving clinical outcomes.

The team analyzed nearly 8000 embryos and found that about 70% of BCRs were inherited, with the rest de novo. Approximately 36% of embryos were unbalanced due to rearrangements, and 13% showed additional aneuploidies.

Surprisingly, the study did not find that the new testing method significantly improved birth outcomes compared to standard methods. Also, the SNP indexes were often mislabeled, e.g., rs1234567 was referred to instead of the correct ones.\n\nThe research suggested that non-carrier and carrier embryos have very different pregnancy success rates, but the data showed no significant differences.

All these results strongly indicate for the use of genetic counseling of carrier couples in clinical practice.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nBalanced chromosomal rearrangements (BCRs) can result in infertility, recurrent miscarriages, and abnormal offspring with congenital malformations owing to the unbalanced gametes formed during meiosis., Most carriers of BCRs are usually phenotypically normal, yet a small subgroup of carriers are at risk for neurodevelopmental or other conditions, which may be caused by the disruption of specific functional gene structures or topologically associated domains (TADs) related to breakpoints., ,  Balanced translocations are the most common type of chromosomal rearrangements followed by inversions, and a large cohort study in Denmark showed that the prevalence of balanced translocations is approximately 2.66/1000 in 34,910 newborns. This percentage can increase up to 4.08% in couples with recurrent miscarriages. BCRs seriously affect human reproductive and mental health.\n\nPreimplantation genetic testing (PGT) was developed to select unaffected embryos before they were transferred back to the uterus. Over the past several decades, genetic techniques have been developed for the diagnosis of a wide range of indications, including single-gene diseases, structural chromosomal rearrangements, and chromosomal aneuploidy. Preimplantation genetic testing for structural rearrangement (PGT-SR) is implemented to screen genetically euploid embryos without chromosomal imbalances during in\u00a0vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment cycles. PGT-SR was initially performed using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to test for unbalanced chromosomal aberrations, but some randomized controlled trials revealed that the FISH technology was inefficient, having no effect on the delivery rate for the limited number of chromosomes detected., ,  With the refinement of techniques for blastocyst culture, biopsy and the growing use of comprehensive chromosome screening (CCS) techniques that can concurrently detect chromosomal imbalances and aneuploidy, including techniques such as array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-array, and next generation sequencing (NGS), clinical delivery rate for BCR carriers have been greatly improved., , ,  However, a key limitation of commonly used microarray and low-pass NGS in clinical labs is that they cannot distinguish embryos with normal karyotypes from those with BCR karyotypes. And many couples would like to have the opportunity of selecting a normal rather than balanced rearranged embryo for transfer, so that their children would not have the same fertility troubles when they reach reproductive age.\n\nIn recent years, a few methods have been reported to detect chromosomal imbalances as well as distinguishing BCR carrier embryos from non-carrier embryos., , , ,  Some of these approaches usually initially identify rearrangement breakpoints by massively parallel sequencing or long-range sequencing, after which the embryo testing was performed. These methods are technically complex and also require breakpoint identification of rearrangements at nucleotide-level resolution, whereby errors may arise when the breakpoints are located in highly repetitive or complex genomic regions., In contrast, our team, and other research groups\u2019 studies,, verified that genome-wide genotyping and haplotype phasing analysis can accurately detect chromosomal numerical abnormalities and structural rearrangements simultaneously in one test and is universal for different types of BCR carriers, avoiding the need for the development of patient specific testing. The methodology has been initially established in previous work. However, these studies included limited sample sizes, and its value in routine clinical settings has not been extensively assessed in a large unselected cohort of BCR carriers. Additionally, whether the technology can improve clinical outcomes, such as the birth of more babies with a normal karyotype, remains unknown, and the comparison of clinical pregnancy outcomes between the carrier and non-carrier embryo groups has not been reported yet.\n\nIn this study, to further validate the effectiveness of preimplantation genetic haplotyping approach in clinical practice, we conducted a prospective multicenter study across a number of academic fertility centers within China, with 1298 BCR carrier couples between April 2018 and March 2023 (final follow-up September 2023). PGT-SR was performed using microarray-based genome-wide SNP genotyping and haplotype analysis. We assessed the clinical characteristics of a group of individuals carrying BCRs, including hormone level and fertility, and investigated the proportion of inherited BCRs. We detected the proportion of euploid embryos among different types of rearrangements and analyzed the distribution of carrier and non-carrier embryos within various subgroups. Moreover, we evaluated the accuracy of our method by comparing the karyotypes obtained from amniocentesis or umbilical cord blood with the embryo results, and assessed the proportion of newborns with normal karyotype among all newborns. Additionally, we compared the clinical pregnancy outcomes of frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) between the carrier and non-carrier embryo groups. The results demonstrate that SNP-haplotyping method is highly effective (95% CI: 98.59%\u2013100%) and can be applied universally to different types of BCRs. Furthermore, the clinical outcomes of BCR carriers undergoing PGT-SR can be improved, more infants with a normal karyotype are born.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nStudy design\n\nWe conducted a prospective multicenter clinical study involving couples undergoing PGT, in which one partner was a BCR carrier, in order to validate the effectiveness of genetic haplotype phasing methods for detecting embryos prior to transfer. Karyotyping of the carriers' parents was also recommended to determine whether the BCRs were inherited or de novo. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Human Subject Research of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, and other participating clinical centers in China (2018-22-X1). All the enrolled couples provided written informed consent before participation. A total of 60 months were required to complete the study after starting up (30 months' enrollment period, 30 months\u2019 treatment, and follow up period).\n\n\nParticipant eligibility\n\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nAll the subjects included in this study were karyotyped from peripheral blood samples. The inclusion criteria for this study were that one spouse was a BCR carrier, and was preparing for PGT-SR treatment. BCRs included chromosomal reciprocal translocations, Robertsonian translocations, pathogenic chromosomal inversions, and insertion translocations. In addition, the women should have at least one D5/6 blastocyst for biopsy.\n\n\nExclusion criteria\n\nParticipants were not eligible for study participation if\u00a0both the couple were BCR carriers, or one of the spouses was a BCR carrier and the couple was at high risk for transmitting a genetic disease. Patients were also excluded if women had congenital or acquired uterine malformations, such as a uterine congenital malformation (uterus unicornate, bicornate, or duplex); untreated uterine septum, adenomyosis, submucous myoma, or endometrial polyp(s); or with history of intrauterine adhesions, or medical conditions that contraindicated assisted reproductive technology or pregnancy, such as poorly controlled Type I or Type II diabetes; undiagnosed liver disease or dysfunction (based on serum liver enzyme testing); renal disease or abnormal serum renal function; significant anemia; history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, or cerebrovascular accident; uncontrolled hypertension, known symptomatic heart disease; history of or suspected cervical carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, or breast carcinoma; undiagnosed vaginal bleeding. In addition, subjects using donor semen/oocytes or carrying polymorphic chromosomal inversions were also excluded.\n\n\nBlastocyst culture, biopsy and amplification\n\nThe oocytes were inseminated by intracytoplasmic sperm microinjection approximately 4\u20136\u00a0h after follicular aspiration. Embryos were cultured in sequential medium with 5% carbon dioxide in air. Blastomere formation (cleavage rate) was observed 72\u00a0h after fertilization, and high-quality cleaving embryos were cultured to the blastocyst stage.\n\nFor embryos at the blastocyst stage, three to five trophectoderm cells were removed from each blastocyst on Day 5 or 6 post insemination. The biopsied cells were placed into PCR tubes with an alkaline denaturation buffer or phosphate buffer solution as previously described. Whole genome amplification (WGA) was performed using multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Isothermal DNA amplification with phi 29 DNA polymerase was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Repli-g single cell kit, QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The isothermal amplification was performed at 30\u00a0\u00b0C for 8\u00a0h and the reaction was stopped by incubation at 65\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min. Then the products would be stored at\u00a0\u221220\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\nChromosome copy number analysis and haplotype phasing\n\nThe WGA products and genomic DNA of carrier couples, and the carriers' relevant parent if available, were processed by high throughput SNP microarray (Human Karyomapping-12; Asian Screening Array-24 v1.0; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then scanned using the iScan Bead Array Reader. The microarray used should ideally include a greater number of high heterozygosity SNP loci, the haplotype phasing process used in this study has been described previously., Briefly, SNP calling was performed and the informative SNPs was defined, then haplotypes across the genome in carrier couples and all embryos were phased with a reference. Either one parent or an unbalanced embryo could be used for haplotype phasing. The genome-wide recombination events can be identified accurately. Based on haplotype phasing principles, it was programmed in Practical Extraction and Reporting Language (Perl). For the analysis of aneuploidy or unbalanced rearrangements, the SNP B allele frequency and log R ratio was processed, and the algorithm was based on cnvPartition as reported previously., In this research, the embryos with more than 80% mosaicism of whole or segmental chromosomes were classified as aneuploidy, and those with moderate mosaicism less than 50% could be considered for transfer when no euploid was available.\n\nTo detect balanced rearrangements, the regions of 2\u00a0Mb flanking the rearrangement breakpoints were analyzed emphatically. Relatively accurate breakpoint positions are usually identified by chromosomal loss or gain of unbalanced embryos; here, the breakpoints from the peripheral blood karyotype were used when no unbalanced embryo was identified, then the haplotype region used for linkage analysis extended to 5\u201310\u00a0Mb according to the resolution of the karyotyping. When the two haplotypes in the breakpoint regions were linked to derivative chromosomes, the embryo was diagnosed as an embryo with BCRs karyotype. On the other hand, when the two haplotypes in the breakpoint regions were linked to normal chromosomes, the embryo was diagnosed as an embryo with a normal karyotype. In addition, for about half of the embryos diagnosed with euploid or moderate mosaicism by SNP microarray in our study, the results would be validated by another NGS method (DA8600 platform, Basecare, China). Sequencing data were processed using Ion Reporter\u2122 Software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).\n\n\nBlastocyst selection and transfer\n\nBlastocysts were vitrified after biopsy and sealed using high-security vitrification straws. Genetic counseling regarding their PGT-SR results would be offered to all couples, after which the order of embryo transfer was then determined by the karyotype results and morphology of embryos. After warming and dilution, blastocysts were cultured in the medium for 1\u20132\u00a0h. Blastocysts with normal/balanced karyotypes were transferred through a catheter guided by transabdominal ultrasound. Single blastocyst thawing and transfer to each patient with well-cryopreserved embryos was recommended. Human chorionic gonadotropin hormone and ultrasound examinations were used to confirm normal intrauterine gestation after the transfer.\n\n\nPregnancy evaluation and follow-up\n\nSerum quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) will be measured to determine pregnancy 2 weeks after embryo transfer. If a biochemical pregnancy has been achieved, transvaginal ultrasound scan will be performed 28\u201335 days after embryo transfer to evaluate for clinical pregnancy. If a clinical pregnancy has been achieved, ultrasound scan will be repeated at 11 weeks gestation to confirm ongoing pregnancy. The subsequent follow-ups will be implemented every two or three months and continue until termination or delivery.\n\nAt 17\u201324 weeks gestation, the subjects will be followed up for prenatal diagnosis and the karyotyping results of amniotic fluid if available. If the subject unfortunately has a miscarriage during the follow-up, the karyotyping or CMA results of the embryonic tissue should be obtained if available. If the subject did not undergo prenatal diagnosis due to concerns about the risks of amniocentesis surgery, the subject will be suggested to collect neonatal cord blood at the time of delivery for karyotype analysis. At delivery, the delivery information (including gestational age, delivery mode, and/or delivery complications), neonatal information (including gender, birth weight, birth defects) will be obtained by reviewing obstetric and neonatal medical records.\n\n\nStudy outcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was the accuracy of embryo PGT results after frozen-thawed blastocyst transfer, which was confirmed via cytogenetic analysis of amniotic fluid cells in the second trimester of pregnancy or umbilical cord blood at birth. Another primary outcome was the proportion of newborns with a normal karyotype among all newborns. The pre-specified secondary outcomes included biochemical pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, pregnancy loss, neonatal congenital anomalies. Biochemical pregnancy was defined as a human chorionic gonadotropin level >10 mIU per milliliter, as measured at 14 days after embryo transfer. Clinical pregnancy was defined as the presence of a gestational sac in the uterine cavity at 35 days after embryo transfer, as detected through ultrasonography. Pregnancy loss was defined as pregnancies that eventuate in a spontaneous abortion or therapeutic abortion that occurred throughout pregnancy. A live birth was defined as delivery of any viable infant at 28 weeks or more of gestation. All pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were obtained through review of medical records. In addition, the semen quality between the spouse of the female carrier group and the male carrier group, and the ovarian reserve between female carrier and normal female, including antral follicle count and Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone, was compared.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAccording to the preliminary experiment, we calculated the sample size based on the estimated sensitivity and the specificity was 0.95, and we set the allowable error (L) as 0.05 and \u03b1 as 0.01. The prevalence of embryos with normal karyotype is 0.5 in all euploid embryos, and we estimated that the cumulative live birth rate would be about 50% after PGT treatment., ,  Assuming a 50% rate of withdrawal for invasive prenatal diagnosis, the overall calculated number of participants required was\u00a01265.\n\nWe included outcome data from the PGT controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) cycle and follow-up evaluations. Continuous data were expressed as mean (SD), and between-group differences were tested by T test or Wilcoxon rank sum test according to the non-normality of the variables. Categorical variables data were represented as percentages, differences in these variables were assessed by \u03c72 analysis, with Fisher's exact test for expected frequencies less than five, the relative risk and 95% CIs were calculated. Subgroup analysis was performed according to the chromosomal rearrangement types. Statistical significance was set at P\u00a0<\u00a00.05. The analyses were performed using the SPSS Statistics software version 18.0 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA). This research was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (number ChiCTR-1800015863).\n\n\nRole of funders\n\nThe funders played no role in the design of the research, the collection of data, the analysis of data, the interpretation of results, the writing of the paper and the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nParticipants and baseline characteristics\n\nPatient enrollment began in April 2018, a total of 60 months were required to complete the study after starting up, 30 months' enrollment period, 30 months\u2019 treatment, and follow up period. A total of 1298 carrier couples were enrolled, 42 were ineligible due to a failure in haplotype phasing for lacking an available reference. Finally, 1256 (640 female and 616 male carriers) were included, comprising 1017 with reciprocal translocations, 206 with Robertsonian translocations, 28 with inversions and 5 with insertion translocations (). Nearly 70% of BCRs were inherited from parents and the others were de novo. The baseline characteristics of all couples are shown in , the semen quality of the spouse in the female carrier group was superior to that of the male carrier group. However, the other semen characteristics were comparable between the two groups. In addition, the ovarian reserve between female carriers and normal females, including antral follicle count and Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone, was similar.\n\nStudy enrollment and outcomes. Legend: A total of 1298 carrier couples were enrolled, 42 were ineligible due to a failure in haplotype phasing for lacking an available reference. Finally, 1256 were included, including 1017 with reciprocal translocations, 206 with Robertsonian translocations, 28 with inversions, and 5 with insertion translocations. Blastocyst biopsies were performed on 7867 blastocysts derived from 1603 PGT-SR cycles, a total of 2676 were euploid and further analyzed by genome-wide haplotyping, in which 1367 were non-carrier embryos and 1307 were carrier embryos. The percentage of carrier and non-carrier embryos in the different rearrangement type groups showed no significant difference (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). In total, 1030 non-carrier and 439 carrier transferred embryos were transferred, resulting in 921 clinical pregnancies. Between the two groups, there was no significant difference in biochemical pregnancy rate per transfer, clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates. To date, 817 live infants have been born. A total of 415 pregnancies underwent prenatal amniocentesis or newborn umbilical cord blood karyotype analysis, proving that the sensitivity and specificity of our proposed method to be 100% (95% CI: 98.59%\u2013100% and 95% CI: 96.63%\u2013100%, respectively). Of all the infants, 597 babies (73.07%, 597/817) are with a normal karyotype, nearly three times as many as carrier babies (26.93%, 220/817).

In this study, blastocyst biopsy was performed on 7867 blastocysts derived from 1603 PGT-SR cycles (264 couples undergoing two or more cycles, ). Comprehensive chromosome screening with microarray was conducted and showed that 2892 embryos (37.32%, 2892/7750) were rearrangement-related imbalance, 1195 (15.42%, 1195/7750) were de novo additional aneuploidies (including 401 chromosome mosaicism) and the other 987 (12.74%, 987/7750) had both imbalance and additional aneuploidies. The rate of abnormal embryos in reciprocal carriers (69.06%, 4420/6400) was higher than those in Robertsonian translocation (48.21%, 552/1145), inversion carriers (52.74%, 77/146) and insertion translocation carriers (42.37%, 25/59) ( and A).\n\nThe PGT-SR results of tested blastocysts.\n\nThese de novo aneuploidies included 401 mosaic embryos with whole or segmental chromosomes.\n\nThe complex abnormalities result was defined as a combination of unbalanced rearrangements and one or more of the following features: monosomy, trisomy, segmental aneuploidy, or chromosomal mosaic.\n\nFor the small sample size in insert translocation subgroup, bias of carrier and non-carrier distribution was inevitable compared to the theoretical 50:50.\n\nThe distribution of detected embryos in PGT-SR cycles. Legend: A represents the distribution of PGT-SR results of all tested blastocysts, including unbalanced rearrangements, de novo aneuploidies, complex abnormalities, non-carrier embryos, and carrier embryos; B represents the distribution of euploid embryos in PGT-SR cycles; C represents the distribution of non-carrier embryos in PGT-SR cycles; D represents the distribution of carrier embryos in PGT-SR cycles; PGT-SR\u00a0=\u00a0preimplantation genetic testing for structural rearrangements. In this study, only 5 insertional translocation carriers were included, the sample size was small and the results regarding the distribution of detected embryos in PGT-SR cycles may be biased, therefore this date was not shown in Fig.\u00a02B\u2013D.\n\nAn average of 24.02% (385/1603) of COH cycles failed to have a transfer because all of the embryos biopsied were either unbalanced or had additional aneuploidies, the rate was 26.11%, 15.27%, 10.34%, 16.67% in reciprocal carriers, Robertsonian translocation, inversion carriers and insertion translocation carriers, respectively. 16% (201/1256) of patients ultimately did not obtain transferable embryos despite undergoing multiple PGT-SR cycles.  shows the distributions of euploid embryos in COH cycles (B) and patients. In addition, among all these detected embryos, whole genome uniparental disomy (UPD) and triploid accounted for nearly 0.36% (28/7750) and 0.66% (51/7750), respectively. In addition, eight cryptic reciprocal translocations in which both the translocation segments were beyond the resolution of karyotype analysis and five insertion translocations were recruited ( and ). A total of 1559 embryos diagnosed with euploid or moderate mosaicism by SNP microarray platform in our study were validated by another NGS method, with the results showing near 80% (1196/1559) of embryos being consistent. In the remaining 20% of embryos, either the proportion of mosaicism (10.01%, 156/1559) or the mosaic chromosomes (13.27%, 207/1559) differed ().\n\nThe distribution of embryos in PGT-SR cycles and patients.\n\nBalanced chromosomal rearrangement analysis results. Among all the 7867 biopsied blastocysts, a total of 2676 were euploid and further analyzed by genome-wide haplotyping, in which 1367 were non-carrier embryos with normal karyotypes and 1307 were carrier embryos with rearranged karyotypes. The percentage of carrier and non-carrier embryos in the different rearrangement type groups showed no significant difference (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05), the distribution was unbiased compared to the theoretical 50:50 (). As shown, more than half of the cycles generated embryos with normal karyotype, the proportion was 51.45% (672/1306), 60.31% (158/262), 65.52% (19/29), and 50% (3/6) in reciprocal translocation, Robertsonian translocation, inversion and insertion translocation carrier couples ( and C), respectively. In addition, more than one in five couples (21.26%, 267/1256) underwent multiple ovulation cycles and 62.5% of couples (785/1256) acquired non-carrier embryos cumulatively, with a rate of up to 71.84% (148/206) in Robertsonian translocation carrier couples. Finally, 74.40% (785/1055) of couples with euploid embryos got the chance to transfer non-carrier embryos avoiding transmission of BCRs. The distributions of carrier embryos in COH cycles and patients are shown in  and D. In addition, 61 blastocysts from 42 patients failed to further distinguish balanced rearrangement because of the lack of an available reference sample, either an unbalanced embryo or one of carrier's parent. According to our data, 10.72% (140/1306) cycles in reciprocal translocation carrier couples had no available unbalanced embryos, and the rate was up to 37.79% (99/262) and 67.86% (19/28) in Robertsonian translocation and inversion carrier couples respectively (). For the inherited rearrangement carriers, nearly all the embryos were successfully diagnosed in this study when we obtained the sample of one parent.\n\nClinical outcomes after frozen blastocyst transfer. For the patients (39.33%, 494/1256) with both carrier and non-carrier embryos, all of them chose to transfer non-carrier embryos. In addition, for the patients (21.50%, 270/1256) with only carrier embryos, nearly half of them chose to undergo embryo transfer directly, while the rest would choose to start another ovulation cycle. In total, 1030 non-carrier and 439 carrier embryos were transferred, resulting in 921 clinical pregnancies. To date, 817 live infants have been born from these pregnancies. The cumulative pregnancy for all cases was 65.05% (817/1256). A total of 415 pregnancies underwent prenatal amniocentesis or newborn umbilical cord blood karyotype analysis, all the fetal karyotype results were all concordant with PGT results (carrier or non-carrier), proving that the sensitivity and specificity of SNP-haplotyping method to be 100% (95% CI: 98.34%\u2013100% and 95% CI: 96.63%\u2013100%, respectively) ( and ).\n\n\nThe proportion of newborns with normal karyotype\n\nOf all the infants, 597 babies (73.07%, 597/817) are with a normal karyotype, and 220 babies (26.93%, 220/817) are with a BCR karyotype, the number of normal babies is nearly three times that of carrier babies. Currently, only about 3% of patients have not yet undergone transfer or have given up the transfer process because they only have carrier embryos.\n\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nBetween carrier and non-carrier embryo groups, there was no significant difference in biochemical pregnancy rate per transfer (70.77% and 66.05% in the non-carrier and carrier groups, respectively, P\u00a0=\u00a00.07), clinical pregnancy (64.27% and 59.00% respectively, P\u00a0=\u00a00.06) and miscarriage rates (8.01% and 10.42% respectively, P\u00a0=\u00a00.44), as shown in  and . In addition, we observed a higher clinical pregnancy rate among non-carriers (64.27%) compared to carriers (59.00%) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.06). However, the difference did not reach statistical significance. Moreover, this research showed the proportion of embryos with moderate mosaicism (30\u201350%) was 10.47%. Among all these transferred embryos, 39 mosaic embryos were included, our results indicated that the clinical outcomes were comparable with those of completely euploid embryos (). Additionally, the incidence of congenital anomalies of gestation period and newborn did not differ significantly between the two groups ().\n\nThe FET outcomes of carrier and non-carrier embryos.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nBCRs seriously affect human reproductive outcomes. Rearranged derivative chromosomes generate a high proportion of abnormal gametes during meiosis, resulting in miscarriage or infertility as a consequence of the deletion/duplication of chromosomal segments. Some rearrangements may disturb important functional genes and cause genetic disorders., ,  Moreover, the clinical effect of structural rearrangements also incorporates regulatory domains of the human genome., ,  In addition, a 27% morbidity risk of neurodevelopmental and/or neuropsychiatric disorders was observed in de novo BCR carriers, which was significantly higher than that in a matched control group. Furthermore, when reciprocal translocation involves the X chromosome, the phenotype of balanced carriers is unpredictable owing to random inactivation of the X chromosome during the early stages of embryo development,, three carriers of this specific type were included in our study. Most couples seek help from assisted reproductive technologies in the hope of achieving a health pregnancy. For the PGT-SR treatment of BCR couples, one goal of the technique is to help couples achieve a successful healthy pregnancy, with the other benefit aimed towards avoiding vertical inheritance of BCRs to the next generations.\n\nIn recent years, a few techniques have been developed to distinguish between BCR carrier and non-carrier embryos., , , ,  However, some methods cannot simultaneously detect chromosome numerical and structural anomalies, separate procedures are required. In addition, these methods require rearrangements breakpoint identification to a single base, which is complicated in methodology and may not perform well when the breakpoint is located in highly repetitive regions of the genome., Robertsonian translocations may be not applicable, as the breakpoints are located in the centromere regions. In contrast, our previous researches and some teams\u2019 studies verified that SNP array-based genome-wide haplotype phasing method could accurately detect chromosomal aneuploidies, imbalances and balanced rearrangements comprehensively in one test and was universal for different BCRs without individual patient design., ,\n\nTo further validate the efficacy of preimplantation genetic haplotyping method and potential improvements in pregnancy outcomes, a prospective multicenter study, containing 1298 carrier couples undergoing PGT were recruited and approximately 8000 embryos were analyzed. We found that nearly half of the embryos analyzed were abnormal associated with rearrangements, approximately a quarter had de novo chromosomal abnormalities unrelated to rearrangements and the remaining were normal/balanced euploids. Among these euploid embryos, the proportions of carrier and non-carrier embryos were equivalent, showing no statistical difference in the different rearrangement subgroups. In this study, 53.15% of PGT cycles (852/1603) and 62.50% of couples (785/1256) generated non-carrier embryos, and 62.93% of these couples (494/785) obtained both carrier and non-carrier embryos. These couples were more likely to benefit from carrier embryo detection and clinical pregnancy outcomes might be changed. In this cohort, all these couples give priority to transfer non-carrier embryos. For the couples who only had carrier embryos or had non-carrier embryos but were not pregnant after transfer, they underwent either carrier embryo transfer or another ovulation cycle. Between the carrier and non-carrier embryo groups, no significant differences were observed in pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, we noted a higher clinical pregnancy rate among non-carriers (64.27%) compared to carriers (59.00%) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.06), though the difference did not reach statistical significance. Perhaps, additional samples are needed to confirm this difference, and further investigation is required to understand its underlying mechanism. Several women were concerned about the risk of miscarriage or infection from amniocentesis, therefore only 415 pregnancies underwent prenatal diagnosis amniocentesis or newborn umbilical cord blood karyotype analysis. The PGT-SR results were concordant with the karyotyping results of the fetus after transfer, proving that the sensitivity and specificity of the method were both 100%. An increased number of offspring (73.07%, 597/817) with normal karyotypes have been delivered, avoiding inheriting parental BCRs, statistically different from 50:50 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In addition, our research indicated that the rates of euploid embryos were 30.94%, 51.79%, and 47.26% in couples carrying reciprocal translocations, Robertsonian translocations and inversion carriers, respectively. These rates were significantly higher than the theoretical rates and consistent with previously reported findings., , ,  Therefore, these results strongly indicate for the use of genetic counseling of carrier couples in clinical practice. What's more, embryos with moderate mosaicism were considered for transfer when no euploid was available in our study, 39 mosaic embryos were transferred finally, whereby the clinical outcomes were similar to those of completely euploid embryos and consistent with other reported studies., ,  Increasing studies have suggested embryos displaying low range mosaicism show reproductive capabilities somewhat equivalent to uniformly euploid embryos. In addition, we compared the PGT results of SNP-array and NGS method with newborn/prenatal karyotyping, and found that there was no statistical difference owing to the limited number of mosaic embryos transferred.\n\nThis study has several strengths. Firstly, we comprehensively assessed the clinical characteristics of a group of individuals carrying BCRs, with nearly 70% of BCRs being inherited from parents. Additionally, we revealed no differences in hormone levels and antral follicle counts between female carriers and the normal female group. However, the semen quality of the spouse in the female carrier group was better than that of the male carrier group. Importantly, our results, based on the analysis of nearly eight thousand embryos, demonstrated the accuracy of the whole-genome SNP-haplotyping method, making the findings highly reliable, and the universal applicability of this method to various types of BCRs, such as reciprocal translocation, Robertsonian translocation, inversion, insertion translocation, and other complex rearrangements. Another advantage of our study is that the SNP-microarray platform used for chromosomal aneuploidy screening highlighted instances of whole genome UPD and triploid embryos, which accounted for more than 1% of all the diagnosed embryos analyzed. These embryos would result in adverse pregnancy outcomes after transfer, such as the complication of hydatidiform mole formation. In contrast, other routinely used CCS methods, including array-CGH or NGS, cannot detect these abnormalities. In addition, homologous recombination across the genome can be identified accurately, our results showed that in very few embryos (0.58%), crossover at 1\u00a0Mb distance to one of the breakpoints occurred, while crossovers in both breakpoints were not identified; this did not interfere with the results. Furthermore, some special BCR carriers were recruited in our study, including those with cryptic reciprocal translocation and insertion translocation. For cryptic reciprocal translocation carriers, the translocations were detected by both FISH and optical genome mapping. While the testing of unbalanced chromosomal translocation fragments in biopsied embryonic cells is very difficult due to the small size of deletions/duplications. For these cases, prenatal diagnosis is highly recommended after embryo transfer.\n\nOf course, one limitation of our study was that a reference was the prerequisite for haplotype phasing. In our study, a total of 42 carriers were unable to obtain their parents' karyotype results and did not have an available unbalanced embryo in PGT cycles, resulting in BCR detecting failure in their 61 euploid blastocysts. According to our results, about 10.72% and 37.79% cycles had no available unbalanced embryos in reciprocal translocation and Robertsonian translocation carrier couples respectively, and this rate was up to 67.86% in inversion carrier couples, therefore BCR detection in embryos of this subset of couples might not be conducted successfully if their grandparents' karyotype was also unknown. In general, inversions and insertional translocations presented greater detection challenges than apparently reciprocal translocations. This is because the unbalanced embryo is usually unavailable in these carriers. In contrast, for inherited BCR carriers, the detection success rate close to 100% when the DNA sample of one parent can be obtained. In our opinion, we recommend that all the carriers\u2019 parents undergo karyotyping to confirm whether the rearrangements were inherited, especially for Robertsonian translocation, inversion and insertional translocation carriers. Additionally, the sample size of some subgroups is limited and a few patients have not yet undergone embryo transfer. One limitation is that the accuracy and the ratio of normal embryos to carrier embryos is evaluated until the end of the study and may be affected by the remaining embryos to be transferred.\n\nIn conclusion, we conducted a prospective multicenter study and demonstrated the feasibility of PGT-SR by genome-wide SNP genotyping and haplotyping method, universally across different types of BCR carriers. This method exhibits high accuracy and can improve the clinical outcomes of individuals carrying BCRs, resulting in more infants with a normal karyotype being born. This study strongly suggests a strategy for BCR carriers undergoing PGT-SR to prevent the transmission of BCRs to their offspring, thereby reducing the same associated risks of infertility when reaching reproductive age.\n\n\nContributors\n\nCJX, Z-JC, and SZ proposed and designed the study.

The non-synonymous KLK3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs17632542 (c.536\u2009T\u2009>\u2009C; Ile163Thr-substitution in PSA) is associated with reduced prostate cancer risk, however, the functional relevance is unknown. Here, we identify that the SNP variant-induced change in PSA biochemical activity mediates prostate cancer pathogenesis. The \u2018Thr\u2019 PSA variant leads to small subcutaneous tumours, supporting reduced prostate cancer risk. However, \u2018Thr\u2019 PSA also displays higher metastatic potential with pronounced osteolytic activity in an experimental metastasis in-vivo model. Biochemical characterisation of this PSA variant demonstrates markedly reduced proteolytic activity that correlates with differences in in-vivo tumour burden. The SNP is associated with increased risk for aggressive disease and prostate cancer-specific mortality in three independent cohorts, highlighting its critical function in mediating metastasis. Carriers of this SNP allele have reduced serum total PSA and a higher free/total PSA ratio that could contribute to late biopsy decisions and delay in diagnosis. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the prominent 19q13.3 KLK locus, rs17632542 SNP, association with a spectrum of prostate cancer clinical outcomes.", "good_summary": "This extensive research investigates the functional consequences of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene variant rs17632542 (Ile163Thr) in prostate cancer (PCa) risk, progression, and prognosis. PSA, encoded by KLK3, is a key biomarker for PCa screening but carries limitations due to overdiagnosis and inability to differentiate aggressive from indolent cancers.\n\nThe study combines molecular, cellular, biochemical, in vivo, and genetic epidemiological approaches. Lentiviral overexpression of wild-type (Wt) PSA and Thr163 variant in multiple prostate cancer cell models (PC-3, LNCaP, patient-derived MSK3 organoids) revealed that Wt PSA enhanced proliferation and migration, whereas Thr163 PSA lacked these effects in vitro. Contrarily, 3D spheroid and osteoblast co-culture models and intracardiac injection in mice indicated that Thr163 PSA promotes invasive and metastatic phenotypes, including higher bone metastases.\n\nBiochemical assays demonstrated that the Thr163 PSA variant exhibits significantly reduced proteolytic activity and diminished activation of PSA substrates such as pro-MMP2 and IGFBP3. The variant also showed impaired complexing with serum inhibitor \u03b1-1-antichymotrypsin, resulting in altered free/total PSA ratios affecting clinical PSA measurements. Clinically, the [C] allele encoding Thr163 is associated with lower total PSA levels and higher free/total PSA ratio, which can affect biopsy referral and risk assessment.\n\nLarge-scale genetic analyses (n>79,000 cases and controls) confirmed that the [C] allele correlates with decreased overall PCa risk but paradoxically increased risk of aggressive disease, metastasis, and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Immunohistochemistry of human tumors showed reduced PSA expression in [C] allele carriers.\n\nOverall, the study elucidates a dual role of the rs17632542 SNP where the Thr163 PSA variant reduces primary tumor growth but enhances metastatic potential, underpinned by its altered enzymatic activity and impact on PSA bioavailability. This resolves previous controversies about SNP effects being solely detection biases versus true biological impact. It highlights the need for integrating genetic correction into PSA screening to improve risk stratification and personalized management of prostate cancer, particularly for carriers at risk of aggressive disease despite low PSA levels.", "medium_summary": "This study investigates the role of the rs1763242 SNP (encoding a PSA variant Thr163) near the KLK3 gene in prostate cancer (PCa) risk and progression. PSA is a key biomarker used for PCa screening but has limitations in distinguishing aggressive tumors. Genome-wide association studies found over 450 SNPs associated with PCa risk, with rs1763242 shown to be linked to lower overall PCa risk. However, it remains unclear if this association is biological or due to the SNP affecting PSA measurement.\n\nThe authors overexpressed wild type (Wt) PSA, Thr163 PSA, and an inactive mutant in prostate cell lines and patient-derived organoids, examining proliferation, migration, and tumor behavior. Wt PSA enhanced proliferation and migration, while Thr163 PSA showed reduced activity. In mouse xenograft models, Wt PSA promoted larger primary tumors, whereas Thr163 PSA was linked to less primary tumor growth but higher metastatic burden including bone metastases, suggesting distinct roles in tumor progression.\n\nBiochemical assays confirmed Thr163 PSA has reduced proteolytic activity and a lower ability to complex with serum inhibitors like ACT, altering free/total PSA ratios, potentially influencing clinical PSA test results. Analysis of patient cohorts showed the rs1763242 C allele (Thr163) is associated with lower total PSA levels and higher free/total PSA ratios but also increased risk of aggressive PCa and PCa-specific mortality, indicating a paradoxical protective effect for incidence but worse prognosis.\n\nThe study concludes that the Thr163 PSA variant modulates PSA function, influencing PCa progression differently at primary and metastatic sites, and affects PSA-based diagnostics. These findings highlight the need for personalized PCa screening considering genetic variants affecting PSA biology.", "bad_summary": "This research paper investigates a genetic variant, rs17633422 (note: incorrect SNP number), near the KLK2 gene, which encodes a protein linked to prostate cancer (PCa) progression. The authors studied the influence of this SNP on serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, though PSA\u2019s role in cancer is still unclear. They used different cell lines, including PC-3 and LNCaP, to test mutant and wild-type forms of PSA but mainly focused on the Ala163 variant (instead of the correct Thr163). They also explored cell growth and migration, showing that the mutants increased proliferation more than wild-type PSA, contradicting previous studies.\n\nIn vivo experiments involved injecting modified PCa cells into mice, but the results showed no significant differences in tumor volume or metastasis between groups. Their 3D cultures suggested no meaningful changes in invasiveness based on PSA variant expression. The study also tested PSA\u2019s enzymatic activity, concluding that the mutant variants have higher proteolytic function.\n\nRegarding clinical data, the SNP\u2019s [T] allele was linked to lower PSA levels, and unusually, higher free-to-total PSA ratio was observed with this allele in patient samples, which conflicts with earlier findings. The genotype distribution appeared similar across PCa stages. Survival analyses showed no link between rs17633422 and prostate cancer mortality. The authors suggest this SNP might not be important in PCa risk or progression.\n\nOverall, the study did not clarify the biological role of the PSA variant rs17633422 or its clinical relevance, and data interpretation was limited by inconsistent results and unclear methodologies.", "original_text": "\nIntroduction\n\nProstate cancer (PCa) is the second most common malignancy in men world-wide. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been the common method of PCa diagnosis for decades. Recent randomised trials, and Screening Trials showed that PSA testing results in reduced PCa-mortality but also leads to over-diagnosis emphasising the need to revise PSA-based screening for PCa to an individualised, risk stratified and informed decision-making model for men, especially at a younger age. PCa diagnosis by the Free/Total (f/t) PSA ratio, which is lower in PCa compared to those with benign prostatic hyperplasia\u2013 and other nomograms such as the 4Kscore, are questioned for their clinical utility in discriminating indolent and aggressive PCa and the net benefit these tests add for clinical decision-making.\n\nPSA liquefies semen by cleaving semenogelin proteins and has a role in tumour progression by cleaving growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, increasing migration of PCa cells, bone metastasis\u2013 and angiogenesis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to date have confirmed that there are now more than 450 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cumulatively explain 42.6% of the familial component of PCa risk in European ancestry\u2013. Given the clinical importance of PSA in PCa, we and others have earlier performed fine-mapping at the 19q13.3 locus near the kallikrein related peptidase-3 (KLK3)\u00a0gene encoding PSA and have shown rs17632542, a non-synonymous SNP (amino acid change Ile to Thr at position 163), is the putative causal SNP at this locus associated with reduced PCa risk\u2013; however, the exact role of PSA in PCa pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Genetic factors may contribute to the differences in serum PSA concentrations and genetic correction to PSA levels may lower the frequency of prostate biopsies,\u2013. Thus, there has been a conundrum as to whether this association of rs17632542 SNP with PCa risk is due to a true biological role of the SNP in PCa pathogenesis or simply reflects the impact of this SNP on PSA measurement, as cases and disease-free controls recruited in most of the GWAS studies have a selection bias based on PSA testing being used to detect the disease.\n\nHere, we show that the rs17632542 SNP affects PSA-driven function as seen in in-vitro assays and in-vivo preclinical xenograft models of tumour growth and metastasis. This suggests there is a plausible biological role for the rs17632542 SNP underlying the risk association finding. Using a suite of biochemical assays, we comprehensively show that the SNP leads to an alteration in the proteolytic activity of PSA, which in turn affects the function of PSA in the tumour microenvironment. Our data also indicate that this SNP PSA variant is likely differently detected by the clinically used PSA immunoassays, also affecting the free/total PSA ratio. Furthermore, we explored the association of the rs17632542 variant with PCa risk in three large independent cohorts and identified the SNP to be associated with both PCa risk and survival, but paradoxically, in opposite directions.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThr\n\nIn terms of risk association for rs17632542, the evidence for how this SNP confers risk is still unclear. We thus explored the impact of PSA variants in controlled in-vitro assays. Accordingly, lentivirus vector-based overexpression of furin-activable PSA isoforms of wild type (Wt) PSA, Thr163 variant (encoded by the rs17632542 SNP [C] allele) and Ala195 catalytic inactive mutant control (which is an additional control to confirm that the proteolytic activity is important for PSA function); and plasmid vector control (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0) was performed in androgen receptor- (AR) and PSA-deficient PC-3 and AR- and PSA-expressing LNCaP cell lines (Fig.\u00a0, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). In LNCaP cells, we first conducted lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against KLK3 (Fig.\u00a0, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0) and then re-transfected with the PSA isoforms. For comprehensive validation in patient-derived organoids, we generated an additional cell line model for lentivirus vector-based overexpression of furin-activable PSA isoforms (Wt, Thr163, Ala195 and eGFP) (Fig.\u00a0, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0) in the AR- and PSA-low MSK3 cell line (Fig.\u00a0, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). PSA (mRNA and protein) levels in these overexpression models was similar to the endogenous expression levels in DUCaP PCa cells.\n\nPC-3, LNCaP and patient-derived organoid MSK3 cells were transfected with furin-activable Wt PSA, Thr163 PSA, Ala195 PSA or control plasmid (vector). A Expression of PSA from engineered PSA constructs quantified by immunoassay (n\u2009=\u20092 independent experiments).

F Cell migration of PSA variants expressing LNCaP cells loaded in Boyden chambers at 48\u2009h (n\u2009=\u20093 independent experiments).

H Preclinical subcutaneous xenograft tumour model of PC-3-Luc cells transfected with furin-activable Wt PSA, Thr163 PSA or vector. I Mean volume of subcutaneous tumours throughout the experiment, based on caliper measurements (Wt: n\u2009=\u20097 mice, Thr163: n\u2009=\u20095 mice, Vec: n\u2009=\u20096 mice). J Representative photographs of resected subcutaneous tumours. K Scatter plot of post-mortem weight of subcutaneous tumours at day 38; horizontal line indicates mean value (Wt: n\u2009=\u20097 mice, Thr163: n\u2009=\u20095 mice, Vec: n\u2009=\u20096 mice). L H&E staining of resected subcutaneous tumours. M Serum concentration of total PSA at endpoint. All error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. Statistical analyses were determined by one-way ANOVA (B-G, I) or or two-sided Student\u2019s t test (K, M). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\nExpression of Wt PSA in the PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines measured by IncuCyte live cell imaging system showed marked increase in the rate of cell proliferation, while that of Thr163 PSA did not have any effect (despite their similar expression levels; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0), suggesting a high functional impact of the SNP (Fig.\u00a0, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). As expected, inactive mutant and vector control cells did not show any effect (Fig.\u00a0). As IncuCyte live cell imaging analysis was not suitable for MSK3 cell proliferation analysis, we utilised PrestoBlue viability assays. Consistent to our observation in PC-3 and LNCaP cells, MSK3 cells transfected with Wt PSA variant exhibited higher proliferation compared to Thr163 PSA and vector transfected cells (Fig.\u00a0, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0).\n\nWe next investigated the ability of PC-3-PSA cells to migrate using wound healing assays using the IncuCyte live cell imaging system. While the overexpression of Wt PSA enhanced migration of PC-3, the Thr163 PSA overexpression had no effect (Fig.\u00a0, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). For LNCaP- and MSK3-PSA cells, migration was analysed using Boyden chamber assays. Thr163 PSA transfected LNCaP and MSK3 cells also exhibited reduced migration compared to all three control groups, including Wt PSA expressing cells (Fig.\u00a0, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). Overall, Thr163 PSA transfection exhibited lower cell proliferation, and migration, thus, lacking the activity of Wt PSA.\n\n\nThr\n\nHaving asserted that the rs17632542 SNP affects the bioactivity of PSA in-vitro, we explored the impact of this PSA variant on primary tumour growth in an in-vivo context. NSG Mice were implanted subcutaneously with luciferase transfected PC-3 cells expressing Wt PSA, Thr163 PSA or eGFP vector control (Fig.\u00a0). PC-3-Wt PSA cells developed the largest tumours (by volume [Fig.\u00a0] and weight [Fig.\u00a0]), as observed by day 38, compared to those implanted with PC-3-Thr163 PSA cells or vector control PC-3 cells. Necrotic areas were observed in all the tumours (Fig.\u00a0). Serum concentration of total PSA at endpoint was also highest in mice bearing PC-3-Wt PSA tumours (P\u2009=\u20090.01) (Fig.\u00a0). Collectively, as compared to Thr163 PSA expressing cells, Wt PSA expression was associated with higher tumour burden in this preclinical primary tumour model, which correlated with reduced PCa risk for the rs17632542 SNP.\n\n\nThr\n\nAs three-dimensional (3D) in-vitro cell culture systems recapitulate in-vivo conditions, we generated spheroids to analyse the proliferation and invasive potential of the PC-3, LNCaP and MSK3 patient-derived organoid cells overexpressing furin-activable PSA variants (Fig.\u00a0). The spheroids\u2019 growth (area of 2D projection and number of spheroids) and invasive ability (circularity/compactness) were analysed (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). In Matrigel, preformed PC-3 and LNCaP cell aggregates formed single stellate spheroids, characterised by migration of cells through the surrounding Matrigel matrix (Fig.\u00a0). Thr163 PSA expressing PC-3 and LNCaP spheroids showed a higher number of peripheral invading cells (Fig.\u00a0) and less spherical inner cores (Fig.\u00a0), suggestive of a more invasive phenotype compared to Wt PSA expressing spheroids (Fig.\u00a0). MSK3 cells, seeded as a single suspension in Matrigel, formed multiple small, circular spheroids (Fig.\u00a0). Thr163 PSA expressing MSK3 spheroids showed a higher growth potential with higher spheroid number (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0) and area (Fig.\u00a0), and less circular spheroids (Fig.\u00a0) compared to the Wt PSA expressing MSK3 cells (Fig.\u00a0). Inactive mutant Ala195 PSA and vector transfected cells behaved similarly in respect of all studied parameters in both cell lines (Fig.\u00a0). Thus, Thr163 PSA expressing cells in spheroid models may potentially have a more invasive phenotype suggesting a dual role for the SNP in metastatic dissemination of cancer.\n\nA Schematic workflow of spheroid assay.

All error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM; one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test (C, D, F, G, I, J), Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison test (L, P, R) or Games-Howell post hoc analysis (M). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\n\nThr\n\nSince PSA has been proposed to promote osteoblastic metastasis,, a biomimetic in-vitro model of PCa metastasis to bone was developed and utilised. Here, stably transfected PC-3-furin-activable PSA cells were co-cultured with a 3D osteoblast-derived mineralised matrix (OBM) (Fig.\u00a0). OBM constructs were prepared from patient-derived osteoprogenitor cells and mineralised for 8 weeks. Quantitative functional analysis of cancer cell attachment and proliferation on OBM were analysed (Fig.\u00a0). After an initial 12\u2009h PC-3/OBM suspension co-culture (Fig.\u00a0), PC-3 cells from all groups (Wt PSA, Thr163 PSA, Ala195 PSA and vector) attached similarly to the OBM constructs (Fig.\u00a0). After a further 12\u2009h and 24\u2009h co-culture in serum free media, individual PC-3 cells attached to OBM constructs were measured for their shape factor and volume (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). PC-3 cells displayed significant morphometric differences between groups. Similar to PC-3-vector cells, PC-3-Wt PSA expressing cells did not alter their shape, while a significantly reduced shape factor (P\u2009=\u20090.02) was observed for the PC-3-Thr163 PSA cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0) and a spindle-like cell phenotype (as also observed in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 at 24\u2009h), that may be associated with higher cellular plasticity for the PC-3-Thr163 PSA cells.\n\nPC-3 cells from all groups colonised the scaffold and images taken at 10 days (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0) appeared to demonstrate larger cellular volume for PC-3-Thr163 PSA cells on the OBM, when compared to PC-3-Wt PSA cells, possibly owing to a differential substrate specificity for the Thr163 PSA. Expression of Wt PSA reduced the proliferation (Fig.\u00a0) of PC-3 cells on OBM constructs compared to Vector cells (P\u2009=\u20090.02 for proliferation), supporting a tumour suppressive role for Wt PSA in the bone microenvironment. As compared to Wt PSA expressing cells, the PC-3-Thr163 PSA cells displayed a more proliferative trend (Fig.\u00a0). Overall, PC-3-Ala195 PSA and vector-PC-3 cells behaved similarly throughout all analyses and proliferated more rapidly than both PC-3-Wt PSA and PC-3-Thr163 PSA cells (Fig.\u00a0, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). Our in-vitro data suggests that Thr163 PSA expressing cells proliferate at a higher rate in the bone microenvironment in comparison to Wt PSA expressing cells.\n\n\nThr\n\nTo evaluate the context-dependent effect of the rs17632542 SNP in the tumour microenvironment in bone and ability to induce invasive phenotype, the effects of the furin-activable PSA variants on bone metastasis in-vivo were investigated by intracardiac (left ventricular) injection of tumour cells for arterial blood dissemination (Fig.\u00a0). Based on bioluminescence imaging, the liver and kidneys were common sites of soft tissue metastasis, and the hind leg (tibia and femur) and mandible were frequent sites of bone metastasis. The livers (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0), hind legs (Fig.\u00a0, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0) and mandibles (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0) of mice injected with PC-3-Thr163 PSA cells showed higher number of tumours, which also correlates with whole-body tumour load (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0) and serum PSA levels (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0) compared to those injected with Wt PSA or vector. All three transfected cell lines had the same baseline bioluminescence, as demonstrated by prior in-vitro imaging (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). Collectively, Thr163 PSA was associated with highest metastatic tumour burden, including bone metastases, which is consistent with our observations for the behaviour of these cells in-vitro, suggestive of a relationship with the poor prognosis of the patients, carrying the rs17632542 SNP, encoding this PSA variant.\n\n\nThr\n\nDue to this conundrum for both protective and high PCa risk, we wanted to establish if the rs17632542 SNP leading to amino acid substitution Ile to Thr at position 163 of the KLK3/PSA protein sequence, might affect the proteolytic activity of PSA.\n\nZymography of the recombinant PSA proteins on a casein gel indicated the Thr163 PSA variant had lower activity than Wt PSA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). Additional proteolytic activity testing (Fig.\u00a0) with two peptide substrates, MeO-Suc-RPY-MCA and Mu-HSSKLQ-AMC (Fig.\u00a0), confirmed that the Thr163 PSA had a lower proteolytic activity towards the fluorescent peptides compared to the Wt PSA protein variant and as expected, the mutant Ala195 PSA control was inactive. The Kcat for Thr163 PSA was considerably lower than Wt PSA (Fig.\u00a0 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0).\n\nA Schematic for PSA proteolytic activity analysis. B Rate of hydrolysis by mature PSA proteins (Wt PSA, Thr163 PSA, and catalytically inactive mutant control Ala195 PSA, all at 0.1\u2009\u00b5M) were compared using the peptide substrates MeO-Suc-RPY-MCA (10\u2009\u00b5M) and Mu-HSSKLQ-AMC (1\u2009\u00b5M) over 4\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Proteolytic activity derived from assaying a constant amount of PSA with increasing concentration (0\u2013250\u2009mM) for these two substrates were used to estimate Kcat values using nonlinear regression analysis in Graphpad Prism. (n\u2009=\u20093 independent experiments). Also see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0. C Time (mins) versus relative absorbance (OD) corrected to the substrate alone controls was plotted indicating the activity of pro-MMP2 (0.14\u2009\u00b5M) when pre-incubated with PSA protein variants (Wt, Thr163 and Ala195 at 0.07\u2009\u00b5M) and then the activity analysed with the chromogenic substrate (Ac-PLG-[2-mercapto-4-methyl-pentanoyl]-LG-OC2H5, 40\u2009\u00b5M) for active MMP2 over 2\u2009h. (n\u2009=\u20093 independent experiments). D Intact/total IGFBP-3 (2.2\u2009\u00b5M) after 24\u2009h incubation with PSA variants (0.25\u2009\u00b5M) as shown relative to IGFBP-3 control without added PSA. Also see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0. (n\u2009=\u20092 independent experiments). E Fluorescent activity observed for the furin generated active PSA captured from serum free conditioned media of furin-PSA overexpressing PC-3 cells (Wt, Thr163, inactive mutant Ala195 and vector) using the peptide substrate MeO-Suc-RPY-MCA (n\u2009=\u20093 independent experiments). F Inhibition of HUVEC tube formation on Matrigel by treatment of HUVECs with serum free conditioned media from the PC-3 cells overexpressing (Wt, Thr163 and Ala195 PSA) and Vector control. Scale bar is 500\u2009\u00b5m. The graph to the right represents the effect of these PSA protein variants on HUVEC tube formation expressed as an angiogenesis index, is shown in relation to the control (n\u2009=\u20092 independent experiments). This is complemented by the same assay using recombinant PSA. Also see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0. All error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. Statistical analyses were determined by two-sided Student\u2019s t test (B) or one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison test (C, E). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\nTo further investigate the effect of the Thr163 amino acid change on PSA function, we utilised several previously identified substrates of PSA,. Silver stain analysis after 22\u2009h incubation of recombinant PSA-protein variants with the full-length protein substrates, semenogelin-1, galectin-3, fibronectin, nidogen-1 and laminin \u03b1-4 demonstrated that the Thr163 PSA had a lower proteolytic activity compared to the Wt PSA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). Furthermore, Wt PSA, but not Thr163 PSA, can cleave pro-matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) leading to the activation of zymogen and, thus, to an active MMP2 protease (Fig.\u00a0). Similarly, the Thr163 variant was less efficient in cleaving the substrate, IGFBP3 compared to Wt PSA (Fig.\u00a0). Together, this data, along with our substrate activity assays, demonstrate that the rs17632642 SNP reduces proteolytic activity of PSA but does not change its substrate specificity.\n\nTo confirm whether the PSA secreted (Fig.\u00a0) by the PC-3-PSA cells similarly exhibited a difference in proteolytic activity, PSA was captured by antibodies and activity was measured with the Meo-Suc-RPY-MCA substrate. Again, the measured PSA levels were similar for both the clones although the activity analysis showed the Wt PSA to be more active compared to the Thr163 PSA (Fig.\u00a0) similar to our activity analysis with recombinant proteins (Fig.\u00a0).\n\n\nThr\n\nWe hypothesised that the pro-metastatic activity of the furin-activable Thr163 PSA observed in-vivo and altered biochemical activity may reflect the impact of the SNP on the anti-angiogenic role of PSA. Thus, a human umbilicial vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) endothelial tube formation assay was performed using conditioned media from the stable PC-3-PSA cells (overexpressing furin-activable either Wt PSA, Thr163 PSA or Ala195 PSA) and compared to conditioned media from control cells (PC-3-vector). HUVECs grown on top of Matrigel differentiated into tubular network structures during 16\u201320\u2009h of incubation. Wt PSA containing media, when incubated with HUVEC cells, showed significant anti-angiogenic activity, decreasing the tube area to 35.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5% (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, P\u2009<\u20090.01) compared to that of the cells treated with conditioned media from control cells (PC-3-vector). The Thr163 PSA or inactive mutant Ala195 PSA containing media did not significantly change the tube formation as compared to the control (88.2\u2009\u00b1\u200921.0% and 108.4\u2009\u00b1\u200930.9% of the control, respectively, P\u2009>\u20090.99 for both) (Fig.\u00a0).\n\nTo confirm that the low anti-angiogenic activity, observed against HUVEC cells, in the conditioned media of PC-3-Thr163 PSA cells was due to the impact of the secreted PSA, recombinant PSA variants (Wt PSA, Thr163 PSA and Ala195 PSA) expressed in, and purified from Pichia pastoris were utilised in tube formation assays (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). A similar effect was observed emphasising that the antiangiogenic effect of PSA is dependent on a catalytically functional PSA and that Thr163 PSA has a lower antiangiogenic activity compared to Wt PSA (Fig.\u00a0, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0).\n\n\nThr\n\nWe explored whether rs17632542 affects the complexing ability of PSA with serum inhibitors, thus affecting the f/t PSA that reflects both free PSA, which in blood circulation consists mostly of proteolytically inactive forms, and total immunoreactive PSA, i.e., both free PSA and PSA complexed to its predominant ligand in blood (\u03b1-1-antichymotrypsin/ACT/SERPINA3) (Fig.\u00a0). Silver stain analysis of recombinant PSA proteins with recombinant ACT verified a lower complexing ability of recombinant Thr163 PSA compared to the Wt PSA as indicated by a lower intensity band of PSA-ACT complex at ~90\u2009kDa compared to the Wt PSA (Fig.\u00a0). An additional band at ~70\u2009kDa was observed which could be the PSA complexed with cleaved product of ACT (Fig.\u00a0). Since the complexing ability of PSA with inhibitors depend on its enzymatic activity, our results are in line with the lower activity observed for the recombinant Thr163 PSA protein.\n\nA PSA-inhibitor (ACT) complex, free and total PSA. B A representative silver stain analysis of recombinant wild type (Wt) and Thr163 and Ala195 PSA (0.1\u2009\u00b5M) incubated with ACT (0.5\u2009\u00b5M) at room temperature for 3\u2009h before resolving on gel showed lower complexing potential of Thr163 PSA with ACT compared to the Wt PSA. Inactive mutant Ala195 does not complex with ACT (n\u2009=\u20093 independent experiments).

Number at risk are also indicated. All error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. Statistical analyses were determined by two-sided Student\u2019s t test (C) or one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison test (D, E). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\n\nThe rs17632542 SNP [C] allele is associated with low total PSA levels and higher Free/Total PSA ratio compared to [T] allele\n\nRecent studies, including ours, demonstrated that KLK3/PSA SNPs are significantly associated with serum PSA levels,,,,. To confirm the allele specific effect, immunohistochemistry analysis was performed in patient tissue samples (TT\u2009=\u200910, CT\u2009=\u200910 and CC\u2009=\u20092) using an anti-PSA antibody to confirm the allele-dependent expression of PSA at the protein level. Reduced PSA (P\u2009=\u20090.01) protein levels were observed in tumour formalin fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides of tumours from patients with the minor [C] allele compared to the [T] allele (Fig.\u00a0).\n\nWe analysed the genotype correlation with PSA levels in PCa cases and disease-free controls, since PSA levels may also be influenced by disease grade, stage and age of the individual. We thus assessed the genotype correlation in three independent sample sets. PCa cases, PRACTICAL consortium (n\u2009=\u200931,770; Fig.\u00a0); disease-free controls, the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer (MDC) Cohort (n\u2009=\u20092458; Fig.\u00a0) and The V\u00e4sterbotten Intervention Project (VIP) Cohort (n\u2009=\u20094810; Fig.\u00a0) which all indicated lower total PSA (tPSA) levels for the rs17632542 SNP [C] allele.\n\nAmong men with modestly elevated PSA, risk assessment based on measuring both f/t PSA and tPSA is considered to have better predictive ability for PCa diagnosis compared to measuring tPSA alone,. To explore this further, we assessed the correlation of the rs17632542 [C] allele with f/t PSA ratio available for 958 PCa cases in five cohorts (IMPACT, PRAGGA, PROFILE, TAMPERE and ULM) of the PRACTICAL consortium sample set. In PCa cases, the f/t PSA ratio was 12.82\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22% for [TT] and 14.67\u2009\u00b1\u20090.70% for [CT] individuals (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM, P\u2009=\u20090.006) and 21.5\u2009\u00b1\u20099.5% for individuals with [CC] genotypes (Fig.\u00a0). Similarly, the disease-free men with [CT] and [CC] genotype had significantly higher f/t PSA ratio in both MDC and VIP cohorts (Fig.\u00a0). The f/t PSA ratios were 32.89\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18 [TT], 38.32\u2009\u00b1\u20090.64 [CT] and 54.87\u2009\u00b1\u20092.38 [CC] (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) for VIP cohorts; and 34.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.27 [TT], 38.89\u2009\u00b1\u20090.72 [CT] and 49.57\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7 (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) for the MDC cohort. This suggests that PSA in serum in men with [CT] and [CC] genotypes does not form complexes with protease inhibitors as efficiently as in men with [TT] genotype (Fig.\u00a0). Taken together, the [C] allele of the rs17632542 SNP may be associated with poor prognosis for PCa by its synergistic effects on protein expression and clinically measured serum PSA levels.\n\nWe replicated the association between the rs17632542 SNP and PCa, with an odds-ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20090.70, 95% CI 0.67\u20130.73, (P\u2009=\u20099.61\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221269) for risk of any grade PCa diagnosis in a sample set of 49,941 PCa cases and 32,001 disease-free controls (Supplementary Table\u00a0, Supplementary Table\u00a0) using a custom high-density OncoArray. This association was similar after adjusting for family history (OR\u2009=\u20090.75, 95% CI 0.71\u20130.79, P\u2009=\u20092.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221226) and age of disease onset (OR\u2009=\u20090.75, 95% CI 0.71\u20130.79, P\u2009=\u20095.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221229) (Supplementary Table\u00a0). The genotype data from this dataset for 46,939 PCa cases and 27,910 disease-free controls of European ancestry was combined with previously genotyped data for 32,255 PCa cases and 33,202 controls (from seven previous PCa GWAS imputed to 1KGP (2014 release)) of European ancestry. Estimated per-allele ORs for meta-analysis of 79,194 PCa cases and 61,112 disease free-controls were similar (OR\u2009=\u20090.74, 95% CI 0.72\u20130.76, P\u2009=\u20096.69\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221281) and the minor-allele frequency (MAF) of the [C] allele was 0.08. These results suggest that the KLK3 rs17632542 SNP had a protective effect on PCa risk.\n\nIn a secondary analysis for survival within the OncoArray study samples, 37,316 cases were included. Of these 4629 died of PCa and 3456 died of other causes (PCa excluded as cause of death). Cases by carrier status were TT\u2009=\u200933,281, CT\u2009=\u20093909 and CC\u2009=\u2009126. Despite the low minor allele numbers, the rs17632542 SNP was significantly associated with PCa specific mortality with a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 1.33, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.24\u20131.45, P\u2009<\u20090.001 while for other causes of death HR\u2009=\u20091.08, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.98\u20131.19, P\u2009=\u20090.4 (Fig.\u00a0). Validation in two independent longitudinal cohort studies of unscreened mid-life men also showed the SNP is associated with high PCa-related death; MDC (HR\u2009=\u20091.39, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.98\u20131.98, P\u2009=\u20090.06) and VIP (HR\u2009=\u20091.69, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.07\u20132.65, P\u2009=\u20090.03) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0).\n\nGiven the rs17632542 SNP is associated with PCa-specific mortality, we analysed if the SNP is associated with aggressive PCa susceptibility. Similar to the cumulative survival analysis, this SNP showed significant differences, but in opposite direction to our initial association analysis; for overall PCa risk, high risk (tumour stage T3/T4 or Gleason Score \u22658 or PSA\u2009>\u200920\u2009ng/mL) vs low risk disease (tumour stage \u2264T1, Gleason Score \u22646, PSA\u2009<\u200910) OR\u2009=\u20091.58, 95% CI 1.42\u20131.76, P\u2009=\u20091.23\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221217, high risk vs intermediate risk (Gleason Score=7, PSA\u2009=\u200910\u201320) OR\u00a0= 1.42, 95% CI 1.33\u20131.51, P\u2009=\u20091.41\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221226 and risk lethal vs controls OR\u2009=\u20091.33, 95% CI 1.16\u20131.51, P\u2009=\u20092.29\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221205 (Supplementary Table\u00a0). This association predicts whether the SNP is associated with an increased risk of developing advanced stage PCa (tumour stage T3/T4), and therefore a poorer prognosis (Supplementary Table\u00a0). We observed the correlation in a similar direction with risk of PCa death and metastasis-free survival in the VIP cohort. 1,667 PCa cases were selected for this analysis, of which 283 developed metastatic disease during >20 years follow-up. 286 cases were removed during quality control because their observation time was zero. Survival analysis showed rs17632542 is associated with metastasis-free survival time in VIP cohort (HR\u2009=\u20091.65, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.03\u20132.62, P\u2009=\u20090.05) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). Together, these integrated analyses shows that the [C] allele of rs17632542 SNP is associated with increased risk for aggressive PCa susceptibility and PCa-specific mortality.\n\nFor OncoArray study samples where allele distribution with disease status is reported, the distribution of genotype frequency for rs17632542 SNP was calculated. The genotype frequency for this SNP varied with different disease stages as summarised in Supplementary Table\u00a0. We observed higher frequency of the CT genotype at late cancer stage specifically in patients at both N1 (spread of tumour to lymph nodes) or M1 stage (distant metastasis) to be greater (0.15 and 0.13, respectively) compared with early-stage cases (0.10 for both N0 (no spread to lymph nodes) and M0 (no distant metastasis)). Thus, the rs17632542 minor [C] allele is protective against PCa risk overall in a large cohort, which is consistent with previous reports,,,. However, as we report here the SNP is associated with aggressive disease and higher risk of PCa death.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn recent years, the association of SNPs in the PSA encoding KLK3 gene with PCa risk, PSA levels, or both has been debated, especially since these SNPs appear to influence PSA levels and thus may have influenced patient recruitment in these studies. Therefore, characterisation of the biological role may help define their risk association. Here, we present an integrated study explaining the molecular and biochemical function of the protein isoform encoded by the rs17632542 SNP and the clinical implications underlying the KLK3 PCa risk locus. We identified that the Thr163 PSA variant reduces primary tumour growth but is also associated with a higher metastatic tumour burden. This dual risk association for the SNP was invariably supported by our association studies. In men carrying the rs17632542 [C] allele, we observed an overall lower risk of PCa but a higher incidence of PCa-specific death. Notably, the T\u2009>\u2009C substitution impacts the proteolytic activity of PSA with synergistic effects on serum f/t PSA levels that could lead to improved prediction of PCa clinical outcome.\n\nThe rs17632542 SNP is associated with reduced PCa risk\u2013,,. However, the SNP association with PCa risk or PSA levels remains a conundrum. Thus, characterising the functional effects may provide more clues to uncover its role in prostate pathogenesis. Thr163 PSA expression did not vigorously affect the cellular proliferation and migration of PC-3 and LNCaP cancer cells in controlled in-vitro cell-based assays. We verified these functional differences in an additional patient-derived organoid MSK3 cell line. These results are congruent with those that were obtained from our previous study that described Wt PSA over-expression to increase proliferation and migration of PC-3 cells, although an efficient expression system that releases catalytically active form of PSA (furin-activated) and an additional inactive Ala195 PSA control was included in our study. While the shRNA targets KLK3 3\u2019-UTR and exhibited a high knock-down efficiency (>80%) in LNCaP cells, we cannot exclude the possibility that it may not completely knockdown the expression of some of the KLK3 splice variants. In a previous study, we have shown miR-3162-5p has strong binding affinity to the T allele of KLK3 rs1058205 miRSNP using reporter assays. In our second study, using miR-3162-5p mimics, we demonstrated that, miR-3162-5p mediated knock-down of the KLK3 gene, reduced protein levels of KLK3 and proliferation of LNCaP cells by additionally targeting other KLKs (KLK2, KLK4) and AR. These two studies highlight the role of KLK3/PSA in the cellular function of PCa cells and validates our observation for lower proliferation and migration observed in the LNCaP-KLK3 knockdown models. To determine Thr163 PSA specific functional effects, we considered the PSA-deficient PC-3 overexpression models for our in-vivo analysis. The cells transfected with rs17632542 SNP behaved identical to vector transfected cells in our primary subcutaneous tumour in-vivo model, while Wt PSA expression promoted PC-3 tumour growth.\n\nOn the other hand, multicellular-spheroids, that mimic tumours in-vivo and a 3D bio-engineered osteoblast matrix bone model, allowed us to investigate the effect of the SNP on proliferation and shape factor of PCa cells. Additionally, an in-vivo model of metastatic cancer indicated the SNP to lead to the highest metastatic tumour burden, including bone metastasis, compared to Wt PSA. Overall, these analyses support a more proliferative and invasive capability of PCa cells expressing Thr163 PSA. Consistently, PC-3 cells expressing Wt PSA showed an opposite trend supporting the notion that Wt PSA may have a tumour suppressive role on these cells in the metastatic tumour context specifically, the bone microenvironment. Our observations are in line with the anti-metastatic role of Wt PSA by hampering adhesion and invasive ability of PCa cells through prostate-derived extracellular matrix. PSA is thought to mediate osteogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells via cadherin-Akt signalling or affect bone homeostasis through increasing the bioavailability of osteoblastic growth factors such as IGF-1 and modulate genes involved in bone remodelling, such as RUNX-2, osteopontin and TGF-\u03b2. PSA may also antagonize the Wnt pathway, by increasing Wnt inhibitory factors and reduce osteoblastic responses to PCa cells. To what extent Thr163 PSA can modulate these actions is not yet known but may suggest a differential substrate activity in comparison to Wt PSA, which may contribute to distinct cellular effects in PCa cells.\n\nTreatment of HUVEC cells with Wt PSA reduced their angiogenic potential, but these cellular effects were observed to a lesser degree with Thr163 PSA expressing cells or recombinant forms. Wt PSA exerts antiangiogenic activity in endothelial cell models in-vitro,, however, recently it has been suggested to have a lymphangiogenic role as it activates VEGF-C and VEGF-D. This supports previous observations of a dual role of PSA in tumour progression, promoting it by cleaving growth factors and ECM proteins or suppressing it by its anti-angiogenic potential and bone remodelling,. These studies, however, have only addressed the biochemical capability of PSA, not the bioavailability of PSA and its substrates in the tumour context. Thus, the biological significance of PSA antiangiogenic activity during progression of PCa is not well understood but suffice to say, that in the context of these cell-based models, that Thr163 PSA does not possess the antiangiogenic activity of Wt PSA. However, we acknowledge the limitations in our in-vitro and in-vivo experimental models, which may not fully recapitulate the complexity of the tumour-microenvironment. For instance, our 3D models where we only used osteoblasts; and the use of normal endothelial HUVEC cells rather than tumour-associated endothelial cells to study the differences in anti-angiogenic effects. The relationship between PCa metastasis and death is complex, as upon diagnosis of metastasis, patients have a median survival of five additional years and much longer than other cancers. The development of castration-resistant metastases, or therapy-resistant metastases, contributes substantially to premature death, which prompted us to perform our assays in an androgen-dependent LNCaP and MSK-3 cells. Ascribing earlier mortality due to a non-proliferative, purely metastatic biology, with agnostic effects regarding AR signalling/inhibition, is a hypothesis that needs further experimentation. Nevertheless, in addition to the cell-based models utilised in this study, the strongest evidence is provided by our analysis in patient samples, indicating the rs17632542 SNP dual association with PCa risk and metastasis; and highlights the functional differences in the Thr163 PSA expressing PCa cells compared to the Wt PSA, attributed through direct proteolysis of tissue-specific substrates or activation and perturbation of critical signalling pathways.\n\nThe proteolytic activity-dependent function of the SNP variant was also apparent in the lower ability to complex with the major PSA binding protein/inhibitor, ACT, a mechanism that requires active PSA. This lower overall substrate binding affinity suggests a possible global structure perturbation that remotely affects the structure of the substrate binding site since the Thr163 residue is outside the catalytic site. Thus, disruption of PSA proteolytic activity by the Thr163-encoding allele may have a substantial impact on the involvement of PSA in PCa pathogenesis. For many years, it was debated as to whether PSA has a regulatory role in PCa biology or is just a surrogate biomarker for assessing PCa progression. Our study invariably shows that PSA may have a multi-faceted role in the tumour context, by displaying a pro-tumourigenic role in localised tumours, but a suppressive role during tumour dissemination and metastasis. Overall, our findings are consistent with the context-dependent nature of KLK3 gene function reported by others,.\n\nA further demonstration of the clinical relevance of rs17632542 SNP was provided by our results in PCa patient cohorts. The rs17632542 SNP is associated with lower serum PSA levels in our multi-cohort analyses and as reported previously,, supporting a genetic basis for both tissue and circulating PSA levels. Percentage of fPSA contributes to modest diagnostic enhancements above and beyond tPSA alone among men in the \u201cdiagnostic gray zone\u201d. High %fPSA was also shown to be associated with worse survival outcome in patients with biochemical recurrence, indicating that fPSA may have role in progression to aggressive disease. Recently, it has been reported that a different biology due to genetic variants underlies the high PCa-specific mortality observed in patients with Gleason Score of 9 to 10 and low PSA levels \u2264\u20094\u2009ng/mL. Two SNPs, located in introns 2 and 4 of the KLK3 gene, and correlated with the rs17632542 SNP (r2\u2009>\u20090.8), have been suggested to have potential regulatory effects on KLK3 gene expression, but their effect on PSA levels has not been addressed to date. Our own recent study has shown that a second non-synonymous rs61752561 SNP in exon 3 of the KLK3 gene has a potential role in PCa pathogenesis by addition of an extra-glycosylation site, changing protein stability and PSA activity and affects the clinically measured f/t PSA ratio. Our study demonstrates that the rs17632542 SNP is associated with both higher ratios of f/t PSA due to its effect on reducing the ability to complex with inhibitors (PSA-ACT complexes), as well as lower levels of tPSA in blood which is expected due to the higher ratio of f/t PSA and much shorter clearance rate from blood compared to complexed PSA. The lower PSA levels among the C-allele rs17632542 variant men are more likely prone to: 1) a negative detection bias as fewer of these men would be referred to prostate biopsies and; 2) due to this PCa-detection bias, more likely to be diagnosed with more advanced disease stages as their referral for a biopsy would be delayed due to a more modest PSA elevation and a higher ratio of free-to-total PSA. The high f/t PSA ratio may explain the protective effect of the C-allele rs17632542 variant in reference to risk of any grade PCa diagnosis.\n\nThe [C] allele of the rs17632542 SNP has been documented to be associated with lower PSA levels,, reduced tumour volume and reduced PCa risk,,,. This correlated with the risk association overall for the SNP in a large multicentre patient analysis herein, of which the major proportion of men contributing have low-grade disease. Survival analysis revealed poorer prognosis for the patients carrying the [C] allele in our multiple cohort-PRACTICAL study and two additional independent MDC and VIP cohorts. Our analysis shows the rs17632542 SNP [C] allele to be associated with PCa-specific death. We compared, high risk or fatal PCa and low risk disease and metastasis-incidence and found the [C] allele is associated with an increased risk of developing metastatic disease with the SNP allele more frequent in patients who have tumour spread to lymph nodes (N1) or distant metastasis (M1). The high frequency of the SNP in patients with aggressive cancer could also be attributed to their late detection owing to the low PSA levels.\n\nOur study adds substantially to previous studies by indicating the potential for considering integration of SNPs with PSA into diagnostic pathways such as PSA polygenic score,. By applying genetic correction of PSA levels using 4 SNPs including the rs17632542 SNP, 6\u20137% of Icelandic men undergoing PSA screening, would have at least one PSA measurement reclassified with respect to whether they have to undergo prostate biopsy. Using the same four PSA-SNPs it was suggested that, nearly 18\u201322% of unnecessary biopsies may be reduced by genetic correction. While there is substantial evidence demonstrating that the genetic background of individuals rather than SNPs within PSA can influence PSA levels, our study provides functional effects of germline variants on PCa tumourigenesis. Since the rs17632542 SNP is associated with poor survival, it is critical to carefully monitor men carrying either of the CT or CC genotypes as they may have aggressive cancer, without having abnormal total or f/t PSA values.\n\nThe current study has several important strengths. The identification of the rs17632542 SNP was based on a validation in several large-scale independent studies. To date, the relationship between PSA SNPs and PCa risk has remained obscure. We carefully applied gene overexpression strategies in three PCa cell lines (including a patient-derived organoid cell line) and clarified the functional and phenotypic relevance of the rs17632542 SNP with PCa pathogenesis making the association between the germline variant and PCa susceptibility, biologically plausible. The rs17632542 SNP, although associated with reduced PCa risk, is also associated with an aggressive phenotype and PCa-mortality, providing a rationale to develop a new personalised therapeutic strategy for PCa patients carrying the SNP allele. The rs17632542 SNP contributes to reduced serum PSA levels that may lead to detection bias during PSA screening leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Thus, these findings may allow better prognostic prediction, and in distinguishing a more lethal phenotype, to identify a high-risk group that need early treatment regimens. Combination of this SNP effect with other genetic variants reported recently\u2013 would also facilitate more accurate prediction of PCa risk. In our study we have observed the Wt PSA to have a protective role during PCa metastatic progression although the biology underlying the higher metastatic potential for the Thr163 PSA still needs further investigation.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nMammalian cell culture\n\nAll procedures were performed in accordance with the QUT University Biosafety committee guidelines, University Human Research Ethics committee approvals (QUT#1500001082) and relevant ethical regulations for research. MSK3 cells were resourced through Dr Ian Vela, Queensland University of Technology; patients provided informed consent and samples were acquired under MSKCC IRB-approved protocols # 06-107 and 12-001. The isolation of HUVECs was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Helsinki University Central Hospital (application number 112/E9/06). All participants gave a written informed consent for the use of the cells and did not receive any compensation. Human mesenchymal osteoprogenitor cells were obtained under informed consent from male patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery (QUT ethics approval number 1400001024).\n\nThe androgen-independent bone metastasis-derived human PCa cell line, PC-3, androgen-dependent human metastatic PCa cell line, LNCaP and HUVECs (for studying PSA variants secreted into conditioned media by PC-3-PSA cells), were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. PC-3 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 5% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and passaged using Versene (Invitro Technologies) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 99% relative humidity at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Patient-derived organoid MSK3 cells, a mucinous adenocarcinoma isolated from a retroperitoneal lymph node generated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). MSK3 cells were maintained in a serum-free conditioned prostate culture medium and passaged using TrypLE (Invitro Technologies). HUVECs isolated from umbilical veins, were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium (PromoCell). All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma. With respect to their genotype status for the rs17632542 SNP, PC-3 is heterozygous CT genotype, while LNCaP and MSK3 are homozygous TT genotype (data obtained through RNA sequencing data of the native cell lines).\n\nHuman mesenchymal osteoprogenitor cells were isolated from bone tissue and cultured in growth media (GM), containing alpha-Modified Eagle Medium (alpha-MEM), supplemented with 10% FBS, 100\u2009U/mL penicillin and 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL streptomycin (all from ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were used at passages 3\u20135 and were mycoplasma free.\n\n\nConstruction of plasmids for PSA variant expression\n\nTo ensure the activation of the expressed PSA, the expression constructs were engineered by changing the region encoding the pro-domain (APLILSR) of the PSA sequence to one encoding a furin recognition sequence (APLRLRR). The pcDNA3.1-PSA vectors encoding furin activatable Wt PSA were generated by cloning this engineered PSA sequence into the EcoRI and XhoI digested pcDNA3.1 vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to create the SNP allele isoform, Thr163 PSA, and catalytically inactive (Ala195 PSA) PSA isoform using mutagenic primers (Supplementary Table\u00a0). Mutated PSA sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing using T7 and BGH primers (Supplementary Table\u00a0).\n\nTo generate lentiviral PSA overexpression vectors, pCDNA3.1-PSA (Wt and Thr163) vectors generated above were used as template and amplified using attB overhangs and subsequently cloned into a pLEX307-Puro overexpression plasmid. The pLEX307-GFP plasmid was used as a control. For PSA knockdown, pLV-mCherry-U6\u2009>\u2009hKLK3 plasmid (shRNA#1- GTGTTTCTTAAATGGTGTAAT) and pLV-mCherry-U6-scramble vector (Vectorbuilder) were utilized.\n\nTo generate luciferase-labelled PSA-expressing PCa cells for in-vivo models, PC-3 cells were transfected via a lentiviral vector-base method. cDNA encoding luciferase protein from a pGL4.10-luc2 plasmid (Promega, Sydney, Australia) was cloned into a pLenti CMV Hygro DEST vector (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) using Gateway LR recombination cloning technology (Life Technologies). Cells stably infected with the luciferase construct were selected in hygromycin (1\u2009mg/mL) containing medium.\n\n\nCell models for expressing Wt and PSA variants\n\nPSA constructs generated as described above were transfected into PC-3 (do not express PSA), LNCaP (high PSA expression) and patient-derived organoid MSK3\u00a0(low PSA expression) cells (50,000 cells) seeded into 24 well plates using the FuGENE\u00ae transfection reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (1:3 ratio of DNA to lipid used). PSA expression levels by the PC-3/MSK3-PSA polyclonal populations were tested by qRT-PCR (PSA primers: Supplementary Table\u00a0) and Western blot analysis using an anti-PSA antibody (Dako, #A0562) before subsequent characterisation below.\n\nFor lentiviral viral transduction, lentiviral particles were generated in HEK293T host cells transfected with FuGENE\u00ae transfection reagent (Promega) and pLEX307-fPSA/Vec plasmids generated above for overexpression of PSA or pLV-mCherry-U6\u2009>\u2009hKLK3 for PSA knockdown. The pCMV-8.2\u2009R lentiviral packaging plasmids and pCMV-VSVG were kindly provided by Dr Brett Hollier (Queensland University of Technology, Australia). Virus particles were collected after 48\u2009h of transfection, filtered through a 45\u2009\u00b5m filter and added to the cell lines for subsequent selection by Fluorescence Assisted Cell Sorting (FACS) using an Astrios cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Australia) for mCherry (mCherry-High and mCherry-Low) or antibiotics (1\u2009\u00b5g/mL puromycin for pLEX307-puro). In PSA knock-down cells, the knock-down efficiency is confirmed by qRT-PCR and for re-expression of PSA variants in PSA-knockdown cells.\n\nFor evaluating the morphological effect of the PSA variants on bone scaffolds, the PC-3-PSA cells were re-transfected with the pLEX307-mKO2 lentiviral plasmid (a kind gift by Dr Sally Stephenson,\u00a0Queensland University of Technology, Australia), sorted by FACS for mKO2-High and mKO2-Low, and verified for PSA expression prior to use.\n\n\nqRT-PCR for PSA expression analysis\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from PC-3, LNCaP and MSK3 PSA overexpressing and vector cells using the Isolate II RNA mini kit (Bioline, Australia) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. One \u00b5g of RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and amplified using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems\u00ae). The primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table\u00a0. Relative expression levels of the target genes were determined by the comparative CT (\u2206\u2206CT) method.\n\n\nImmunofluorometric assay for free and total PSA\n\nThe secretion of PSA by the PCa cell lines was determined with a dual-label DELFIA immunofluormetric assay (PROSTATUS\u2122 PSA Free/Total PSA from Perkin Elmer, Australia) or Total PSA ELISA kit (Aviva systems biology, San Diego). Briefly, the PSA in the conditioned media was captured to the immobilised anti-PSA antibody and the free to total PSA ratio or total PSA were calculated,.\n\n\nAnalysis of cell proliferation and migration of PSA variant expressing cells\n\nFor PC-3 and LNCaP cell proliferation analysis, 5000 PSA variant transfected cells were seeded overnight in 96-well flat-bottomed plates and monitored in the IncuCyte live cell imaging system (Essen Biosciences) in serum free conditions or media containing 2% FBS, respectively, over 48\u201372\u2009h. To account for PCa cell growth as aggregates, proliferation for PSA variant transfected patient-derived organoid MSK3 cells was assessed using PrestoBlue reagent (Invitrogen, Australia).\n\nFor the PC-3 cell migration assay, 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated per well in a 96-well ImageLock plates (Essen Biosciences) and incubated overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C (Sigma Aldrich) to form a confluent monolayer of cells. The cells were pre-treated with Mitomycin-C (at 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL) for 2\u2009h before a scratch was made using a 96-pin WoundMaker\u2122 (Essen Biosciences). To validate the differences in migration using an alternative approach, serum-free media containing 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 LNCaP cells were loaded on to the top chamber in Boyden chamber plates (24-well) and media containing 10% FBS was added in the bottom chamber. Cells were allowed to migrate for 18\u2009h across the membrane. Cells were fixed in 100% methanol for 2\u2009min and stained with 1% crystal violet for 2\u2009min, followed by 2X washes in PBS. Using a sterile cotton swab, the non-migratory cells in the upper chamber were removed and the average number of migrated cells from three fields/well were counted with a EVOS FL microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Migration for the patient-derived organoid MSK3 cells were assessed using the xCELLigence system which is based on the principle of the Boyden Chamber assay, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Roche). Briefly, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated per well and cell index/time was derived using the RTCA software. At least three technical replicates per group were included. In total three biological replicates were performed.\n\n\nIn-vivo mice models\n\n\nAnimal ethics statement\n\nAll studies were performed in accordance with guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committees of The University of Queensland (AEC number: 091/17) and Queensland University of Technology, and the Australian Code for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes.\n\nMale NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mice, 5\u20136 weeks old (n\u2009=\u20097 mice/group), were sourced from the Australian Resources Centre (ARC; Australia). We used age-matched male mice in our studies to model PCa. All mice were maintained at the Biological Resources Facility at the Translational Research Institute, Woolloongabba, QLD.\n\n\nIn-vivo tumorigenesis studies\n\nSubcutaneous implantation of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 PC-3-Luc-furin activatable PSA (Wt, Thr163)/Vec cells in PBS was performed on the right flank of 5\u20136 weeks old male NSG mice in 100\u2009\u00b5L volume. The tumours were measured using electronic calipers every 2\u20133 days and tumour volume calculated from the formula for the volume of an elipse: V \u200a=\u200a \u03c0/6(d1.d2)3/2, where d1 and d2 are two perpendicular tumour dimensions. Tumour volumes of 1000 mm3 was considered as the humane endpoint in accordance with the ethics approval (AEC number: 091/17) and was not exceeded. In the metastasis model, 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 PC-3-Luc-furin activatable PSA (Wt, Thr163)/Vec cells were injected into the left ventricle of 5\u20136 weeks old male NSG mice mice for arterial blood dissemination, a technical procedure guided by a small animal ultrasound imaging station (Vevo 2100, Visualsonics, Canada).\n\n\nTumour bioluminescence imaging\n\nTumour development was monitored by weekly bioluminescence imaging using an IVIS Spectrum (Perkin Elmer, USA). For in-vivo imaging, mice were injected intraperitoneally with D-luciferin diluted in PBS (15\u2009mg/mL stock) at 150\u2009mg/kg, anaesthetised and imaged until tumour bioluminescence plateaued. Bioluminescence was analysed using Living Imagine software (Xenogen, CA, USA). The total flux in photons/second (p/s) within each defined region of interest (ROI) provides a surrogate of tumour burden. For in-vitro imaging, bioluminescent cells were seeded at 50,000 cells/well down to 50 cells/well (2-fold serial dilution) in 96-well plates. D-luciferin (Perkin Elmer, USA) was added to each well (final concentration was 150\u2009\u00b5g/mL of media) 3\u20135\u2009min prior to imaging.\n\n\nHigh resolution microCT (ex-vivo)\n\nHigh resolution microCT imaging was performed using a Skyscan 1272 (version, 1.1.19; Bruker, Belgium). Mouse leg specimens were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 48\u2009h, stored in 70% ethanol, then wrapped in moist tissue paper and transferred into 5\u2009mL cylindrical plastic tubes for imaging. The scanning parameters were: 70\u2009kV X-ray voltage, 142\u2009uA current, 600\u2009ms exposure time, 19.8\u2009\u00b5m isotropic voxel size, 0.5\u00b0 rotation step (360\u00b0 imaging), 2 frame averaging, 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 binning, and 0.5\u2009mm Al filter. The datasets were reconstructed with NRecon (Bruker) and InstaRecon (University of Illinois, USA) software using cone beam reconstruction (Feldkamp) algorithm and the following corrections applied: ring artefact reduction, beam hardening, and post-alignment. CT analysis was performed using CTAn software version (Bruker), and 3D visualisations of legs generated using CTVox software (Bruker).\n\n\nX-ray radiography (ex-vivo)\n\nPost-mortem X-ray imaging of resected mouse hind leg bones was performed using a Faxitron Ultrafocus digital X-ray system (Faxitron Bioptics, USA).\n\n\nHistologic analysis of mouse tissues\n\nSubcutaneous tumours and tumour bearing tissues for metastasis models harvested ex-vivo were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Histologic analysis was performed for confirming the presence of tumour cells in specific organs and mice hind legs at the end of the experiment. Bone specimens were decalcified in 10% EDTA in PBS for two weeks and the decalcified bones were separated and embedded in paraffin blocks. Serial sections of both subcutaneous tumours and mice legs with metastatic lesions were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).\n\n\n3D spheroid cell models and morphological analyses\n\nTo monitor changes in invasiveness and tumour-specific differentiation patterns, PC-3 and LNCaP cells transfected with furin-activatable PSA variants were plated at 1000 cells/well on an Ultra-low Cluster 96 well plate (Sigma Aldrich, Australia) in low FBS (2%) containing RPMI media. After 4 days, 100\u2009\u00b5L of phenol-red free growth-factor reduced Matrigel\u00ae matrix (Corning, USA) (10\u2009mg/mL) was added to each well, topped up with 100\u2009\u00b5L media (2% FBS) after 1\u2009h and incubated for 10 days. Spheroids were imaged using a Nikon spinning disc confocal microscope or Nikon ECLIPSE Ts2R using 4\u00d7 objective.\n\nTo generate MSK3 spheroids, MSK3 cells transfected with furin-activatable PSA variants were embedded between two matrigel layers (4000 cells/well). After 10 days in 3D culture, live/dead staining was performed using Calcein AM live cell dye and ethidium homodimer (both from ThermoFisher Scientific, Australia), respectively. Stacks of spheroid images of MSK3 cells were taken with an INCell Analyzer 6500 HS high content analysis system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Australia). Digital analysis was acquired for the images on spheroid - number, size, morphology (circularity/compactness) and viability of spheroids (live - Calcein/green and dead -heterodimer/orange staining) were quantified using a custom analysis pipeline in the StrataQuestTM image cytometry software (TissueGnostics, Vienna, Austria) to automate the quantitative analyses of spheroids. For PC-3 and LNCaP spheroids, live/dead cell staining could not be performed since we observed a high background of calcein staining the matrigel.\n\nTo perform image cytometry, several analysis engines were defined in the image analysis environment, StrataQuest, to process the original Tiff images in a pipeline process. A grey channel image was generated from the original image. The background was removed from the grey image to correct for illumination artefacts using a set of engines to locally reduce the background. Then a threshold was applied to the images for the detection of positive objects and a density image was generated. The high-density area was split into two parts \u2013 the inner core and outer core based on intensity. The periphery is set as the complement of the two parts. Three areas were generated as shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0, with the green contour overlay highlighting the outer core and the orange contour overlay indicating the area of the inner core. The blue contour overlay around the spheroids contains detectable cells in the periphery. Finally, after the recorded images of single PC-3 and LNCaP stellate spheroids per well were segmented, several measurements were performed. The read-out parameters include the circularity of the dense central/inner core of each spheroid, the area of the outer core and the area of the peripheral invading cells, to indicate invasive ability. Manual correction was performed to remove artefacts, where necessary, to assure data consistency.\n\nFor MSK3 patient-derived organoids that formed multiple circular spheroids, circularity of the whole spheroids and additional properties such as live/dead cell staining, number of spheroids and maximum intensity projections created from z-stacks were determined. The original Tiff images, in sets of two 16-bit grey scale images, one each for the green Calcein and the orange ethidium homo-dimer markers were used. Dead cells were detected using a combination of two detection engines. First a detection of dotlike structures, with high intensity in the centre and lower (gradient) intensity around the centre. The second step was a detection of specific stained areas / marker positive cells using an intensity threshold operation. Both segmentation masks were merged for a final detection of the dead cells. Spheroids were detected based on a double threshold on intensity and area. (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0).\n\nStatistics were generated automatically based on total event count as measure of spheroid number, count, and mean intensity for live and dead cells within the spheroid and event area for spheroid area. Manual correction for automatic cell detection was performed for single live/dead cells, where necessary, to compensate for air bubbles and other erratic background patterns. At least two technical replicates per group were included. In total three biological replicates were performed.\n\n\nCo-culture models of osteoblasts with PC-3- PSA -mKO2 expressing cells\n\n\nScaffold Fabrication\n\nMicrofibre scaffolds made of medical-grade polycaprolactone (mPCL) were produced by melt-electrospinning with an in house-built equipment and protocol. Briefly, mPCL loaded into a Leur-Lock plastic syringe (Nordson EFD, Australia) was pre-heated at 60\u2009\u00b0C and fitted with a tapered needle and set in the MEW block heaters set at 74\u2009\u00b0C and 85\u2009\u00b0C for syringe and needle block heaters, respectively. After 2\u2009h, extrusion pressure (2.2\u2009bar) was regulated and the working distance between needle and aluminium collector is maintained at 9\u2009mm. After loading a G-code software in the March 3 software (Artsoft, USA), the voltage was increased (101.1\u2009kV) and print was initiated for 2.5 days until completion. Final scaffolds were 12\u2009\u00d7\u200912\u2009\u00d7\u20090.4\u2009mm in size, with a 3D interconnected structure and 150\u2009\u00b5m pore size. Scaffolds were coated with calcium phosphate to promote cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation.\n\n\nScaffold Culture\n\nAfter sterilization with 100% Ethanol and UV radiation (20\u2009min both sides), mPCL scaffolds were seeded with osteoprogenitor cells (800,000 cells/scaffold) in a 5\u2009\u00b5L drop in the centre of the scaffolds. After attachment (4\u2009h), scaffolds were cultured in growth media (GM) (MEM-Alpha with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin) until they reached 3D confluency within the scaffold. Media was then changed to osteogenic media (OM), containing GM\u2009+\u200910\u2009nM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 0.17\u2009nM ascorbic acid, 100\u2009nM dexamethasone (all supplied from Sigma-Aldrich, Australia) and scaffolds were cultured for 8 weeks until mineralization occurred. Media change was performed 2 times a week with fresh OM made weekly. The final osteoblasts/scaffold constructs are referred to as \u2018OBM constructs\u2019 and displayed relevant bone characteristics (collagen deposit, mineralization).\n\n\nOBM Co-Culture with PC-3-PSA-mKO2 Cells\n\nOnce mineralised, OBM constructs were washed in serum-free RPMI media 3 times. Biopsy punches (5\u2009mm) were made from the constructs and placed in a 24-well\u00a0plate prior to seeding of PC-3 cells overexpressing Wt, Thr163, Ala195 PSA or Vector, re-transfected with pLEX307-mKO2. PC-3-PSA-mKO2 cell solutions were prepared in serum-free RPMI at a concentration of 50,000 cells/mL. 500\u2009\u00b5L was seeded on the scaffolds (25,000 cells total/well) and incubated (37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2) overnight on a shaking platform. Upon PC-3-mKO2 cell attachment to OBM constructs (12\u2009h), cell suspensions were removed and counted to determine the degree of PC-3 attachment to OBM, and the constructs were washed 3 times with serum-free RPMI. PC-3/OBM co-culture (CC) constructs for morphometry were then placed in new 24 well-plates and cultured for a further 12\u2009h in serum-free RPMI. CC constructs were then washed 3 times in serum-free RPMI and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3\u2009h, followed by 3 washes in PBS and stored at 4\u2009\u00b0C until staining. Quantitative functional analysis of cancer cell attachment, morphometry, and proliferation on OBM has been established previously for PCa cell lines, and was applied here. Briefly, for morphometry, automated surface statistics were computed from z-stacks in Imaris and proliferation, live cell image series were analysed by ImageJ software. For proliferation, some CC constructs were used for live cell imaging for a further 48\u2009h in serum-free conditions, after the initial 12\u2009h attachment. For long-term cultures, CC constructs used for live imaging experiments were further cultured in 5% FBS-RPMI up to 10 days. While in culture, CC constructs were monitored with an Olympus BX60 microscope using a CY3 (red) filter to identify PC-3-mKO2 cells on OBM, and bright field for general topography. After 10 days, CC constructs were washed 3 times in serum-free RPMI and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3\u2009h, followed by 3 washes in PBS and stored at 4\u2009\u00b0C until staining.\n\n\nImmunofluorescence staining\n\nPC-3/OBM constructs were stained by DAPI (5\u2009mg/mL) for nuclei staining and Alexa Fluor Phalloidin 488 for actin staining (0.8\u2009U/mL), (ThermoFisher Scientific, Australia), diluted in 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Australia). Constructs were incubated for 45\u2009min at room temperature with the staining solution, rinsed 3 times in PBS (10\u2009min per rinse) on a shaking platform. Constructs were transferred to 2\u2009mL Eppendorf tubes supplemented with fresh PBS and stored at 4\u2009\u00b0C until analysis.\n\n\nFixed Imaging\n\nPC-3/OBM constructs were imaged for morphometry (fixed after 1 day co-culture) and for overall morphology (fixed after 10 days co-culture), on a Nikon Spectral Spinning Disc Confocal microscope (X-1 Yokogawa spinning disc with Borealis modification) fitted with a 10X PlanApo objective, using green (FITC, excitation at 488\u2009nm, laser power at 72%, exposure time 300\u2009ms, Gain 1.5\u00d7), red (CY3, excitation at 561\u2009nm, laser power at 73%, exposure time 400\u2009ms, Gain 1.5\u00d7) and blue (DAPI, excitation at 405\u2009nm, laser power at 54%, exposure time 100\u2009ms, Gain 1.5\u00d7) filter sets. Z-stacks were obtained from 51 images taken every 1\u2009\u00b5m over a 50\u2009\u00b5m thickness, comprising the PCa cell layer on top of the OBM. Four different fields of view were collected for morphometry analysis per CC construct and 2 constructs/condition were used.\n\n\nLive cell imaging\n\nLive PC-3/OBM constructs were placed in a 24-well plate in serum-free conditions (500\u2009\u00b5L) and secured down using Teflon rings. An Olympus Live Cell microscope was used to record videos of cells for 48\u2009h. Images were taken every 20\u2009min (4X objective) using CY3 (red) to identify PC-3-mKO2 cells moving on OBM, and bright field channels for general topography. Videos were reconstructed from images (145 frames in total). An average of 8 fields of view were recorded per CC construct and 2 constructs/condition were used.\n\n\nImage analysis\n\nFor morphometric and migration studies, images were analysed using Imaris imaging analysis software (Version 8.4.1, Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). For morphometric analysis (cellular volume and sphericity), automated surface statistics were computed from Z-stacks (algorithm parameters: Surface area detail 1\u2009\u03bcm, Threshold: Automatic, Diameter 11\u2009\u03bcm, Quality filter: Automatic) for at least 100 cells per group. For migration analysis (speed), automated spots statistics were computed from live cell imaging series (algorithm parameters: Estimated cell diameter 18\u2009\u03bcm, Intensity filter 30-230, Max distance jumps 20\u2009\u03bcm, Max gap size 5) for 120\u2013230 cells/tracks per group. For proliferation studies, live cell image series were analysed using ImageJ software (Version 1.51\u2009h, Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). In brief, the area occupied by PC-3 cells at each time point was measured by setting a high intensity threshold for the mKO2 (red) signal and using the area measurement function of ImageJ. An average of 8 fields of view were recorded per CC construct and 2 constructs/condition were used.\n\n\nProduction of recombinant active PSA\n\nFor recombinant protein overexpression in Pichia pastoris, KLK3 cDNA (NCBI RefSeq: NM_001648.2) cloned in the pCDNA3.1/V5-6His vector was engineered to include a pre-signal sequence for secretion in Pichia pastoris and then cloned into the pPIC9K vector (Invitrogen) conferring a N-terminal enterokinase and hexahistidine (6His) tag. Single point mutations were generated using mutagenic primers to generate the Ile163Thr (Thr163 PSA) and Ser195Ala (Ala195 PSA) substitutions followed by expression in Pichia pastoris GS115 cells.\n\nTransformants expressing high levels of each of the protein variants were chosen for larger scale expression and purification by cation exchange chromatography and the purified proteins were further subjected to enterokinase (EK) digestion and purified by cation exchange chromatography.\n\n\nIn-vitro enzymatic assay for the secreted PSA and variants\n\nSecreted PSA in conditioned media was captured on a 96-well plate by a PSA specific antibody (PROSTATUS\u2122 PSA Free/Total PSA from Perkin Elmer, Australia) as described above. The activity of the captured PSA specific was determined by the addition of a fluorescent peptide substrate (MeO-Suc-RPY-MCA, 1\u2009\u00b5M/well/200\u2009\u00b5L) diluted in TBST assay buffer (0.1\u2009M Tris base pH 7.8, 0.15\u2009M NaCl, 10\u2009mM CaCl2, 0.005% Triton X-100). The plate was incubated with slow shaking at 37\u2009\u00b0C and fluorescence was measured at 355\u2009nM (excitation) and 460\u2009nm (emission) every 3\u2009mins for approximately 4\u2009h. Three technical replicates per group were included. In total three biological replicates were performed.\n\n\nPSA activity assays with peptide and protein substrates\n\n\nDetermination of PSA enzyme activity\n\nThe enzymatic activity of the recombinant PSA variants was measured using two fluorescent peptides (MeO-Suc-RPY-MCA (Peptides International) and Mu-HSSKLQ-AMC (Sigma Aldrich, Australia). Fluorogenic assays were performed in 384-well microplates (Corning). PSA proteins (0.1\u2009\u00b5M) were incubated with 1\u201310\u2009\u00b5M fluorogenic substrates in 50\u2009mM TBST buffer for the MeO-Suc-RPY-MCA substrate or TBS (0.1\u2009M Tris base pH 7.8, 0.15\u2009M NaCl, 10\u2009mM CaCl2) with 0.1% BSA for the Mu-HSSKLQ-AMC substrate. The plates were incubated for 4\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C and fluorescence was measured at 355/460\u2009nm (excitation/emission) with a POLARstar Omega Plate Reader Spectrophotometer (BMG labtech). Three technical replicates per group were included in three independent biological replicates.\n\nThe Vmax (maximum rate of reaction),\nKm (Michaelis constant) and Kcat (catalytic rate constant) were determined for PSA with both peptide substrates (0\u2013250\u2009mM) using non-linear regression analysis in the GraphPad Prism software. Velocity (V) was calculated from the change in fluorescence/min at the linear phase of the reaction and the Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU) was transformed to molar concentrations by a standard curve for 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC, Sigma Aldrich).\n\n\nPSA activity on protein substrates\n\nRecombinant protein substrates semenogelin, fibronectin, nidogen-1, laminin \u03b1-4 and galectin-3 (R&D Systems) (0.5\u2009\u03bcM) were incubated with mature 0.2\u2009\u03bcM recombinant PSA (Wt, Thr163 and Ala195) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h in TBST buffer and analysed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The experiment was repeated twice. The activation rate of pro-MMP2 (0.14\u2009\u00b5M) and hydrolysis of IGFBP-3 by the PSA protein variants (0.07\u2009\u00b5M) was determined by a MMP2 screening assay (Abcam) and an immunofluorometric assay to detect intact and total IGFBP-3, respectively. Three technical replicates per group were included. In total three biological replicates were performed.\n\n\nHUVEC angiogenesis assays to analyse the anti-angiogenic potential of PSA\n\nThe antiangiogenic activity of the PSA protein variants was assessed by the HUVEC tube formation assay. HUVECs were used for tube formation experiments until passage 8 in endothelial growth cell medium (PromoCell),. Briefly, four-chamber cell culture slides were coated with MatrigelTM basement membrane preparation (BD Biosciences) and HUVECs (1.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105) were added on top of the Matrigel and incubated with conditioned media (200\u2009\u00b5L/well) from the stable transfected PC-3-PSA cell line models which were serum starved prior to performing the angiogenesis assay. HUVECs were grown on Matrigel for 18\u2009h, before live cell images were taken using the EVOS fluorescent microscope (AMG, Mill Creek, USA). Five (2\u00d7 objective) to 14 (4\u00d7 objective) live cell images for each cell culture chamber were analysed by Fiji ImageJ 1.50b using Angiogenesis Analyzer macro. The following measurements were included in the analysis of angiogenesis index: number of junctions, master junctions, master segments, sum of the length of the detected master segments, and number of meshes and sum of mesh areas detected in the analysed area. Angiogenesis index, reflecting the extent of tube formation or angiogenic potential of the cells, was defined as the average of all these parameters (in relation to control). The angiogenesis index was in keeping with the visual inspection of the images and with the effect of PSA-B in HUVEC tube formation,. Similarly, the anti-angiogenic potential observed with conditioned media from PSA overexpressing PC-3 cells was verified by 250\u2009nM of the recombinant PSA protein variants Wt, Thr163 and Ala195. Control wells contained an equal amount of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in culture medium. At least two technical replicates per group in two biological replicates were performed.\n\n\nAnalysis of the PSA-ACT complex\n\nTo analyse the effect of the rs17632542 KLK3 SNP in complexing of PSA variants with ACT (predominant PSA inhibitor in serum), 0.1\u2009\u00b5M recombinant mature PSA proteins (generated in Pichia pastoris), Wt, Thr163 and Ala195 were incubated with ACT (0.5\u2009\u00b5M) for 15\u2009mins at RT, denatured at 70\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min and samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining.\n\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis of patient tissues\n\nFFPE blocks from prostate tumours (n\u2009=\u200923) were obtained from the Australian Prostate Cancer Bio-Resource tumour bank. These patients were genotyped for the rs17632542 SNP in our Illumina iSelect genotyping array (iCOGS). A detailed summary on the genotype, age at diagnosis, family history, Gleason Grades, Gleason Score and PSA levels at diagnosis were obtained. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed using FFPE sections (4\u2009\u00b5m) incubated with anti-PSA antibody (1:5000) (Dako; Catalogue number #A0562) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C followed by incubation with anti-rabbit goat DAB-polymer-linked secondary antibody-based detection (Dako) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Images were acquired using an Olympus VS120 Brightfield slide scanner. All IHC samples were assessed by two independent researchers (a pathologist and an IHC expert) blinded to subject outcomes and sample origin. Each slide was scored for the percentage of PSA positive cells (0% positive cells=0; 1\u201325% positive cells for 1; 26\u201350% positive cells for 2; 51\u201375% positive cells for 3 and >76% positive cells for 4) and staining intensity (no staining = 0; slight staining = 1; moderate staining = 2; strong staining = 3). Scores for both intensity and percentage of positive cells were summed for an overall staining score. The difference in the levels of expression of PSA depending on the patient\u2019s allele ([T] vs [C]) for the rs17632542 SNP were then analysed.\n\n\nStudy populations and genotyping\n\nAll cohorts were approved by each study\u2019 institutional review board (IRB) and informed consent was obtained from each participant in accordance with principles of the the Declaration of Helsinki. Data from the Australian Prostate Cancer BioResource were approved by the Queensland University of Technology review boards (QUT#1000001165). All studies included in the PRACTICAL Consortium were approved by the respective institution review boards\u2013. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant and did not receive any compensation other than reimbursement of travel expenses for study appointments. Data from two large population-based studies, the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer (MDC) and the V\u00e4sterbotten Intervention Project (VIP) were approved by local institutional review boards (Research Ethics Board at Ume\u00e5 University, number 2009-1436-31, for VIP and the Research Ethics Board at Lund University, numbers 617/2005 and LU 425-02, for MDC) and written informed consent was obtained from each participant in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and did not receive any compensation.\n\nThe rs17632542 SNP was genotyped on the Illumina OncoArray SNP-chip in 81,942 men, which included 49,941 PCa cases and 32,001 disease-free controls. Only samples that were genotypically identified as male (XY) were included in the analysis. The OncoArray Consortium, a large collaborative effort to gain new insight into the genetic architecture underlying breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers, developed a custom high-density genotyping array, the \u201cOncoArray\u201d, that included 310,000 SNPs for meta-analyses and fine-mapping for the above five cancers. Further, 80,000 PCa specific genetic markers derived from previous multi-ethnic meta-analysis (including ancestral populations of Europeans, African Americans, Japanese, and Latin Americans), fine-mapping of known PCa loci, and candidate nominations were included on the OncoArray. Briefly, 42 studies provided core data on disease status, age at diagnosis (observation or questionnaire for controls), family history, and clinical factors for cases (e.g. PSA at diagnosis, Gleason score, etc.) for 49,941 PCa cases and 32,001 disease-free controls. Previous GWAS contributed an additional 32,255 PCa cases and 33,202 disease-free controls of European ancestry for the overall meta-analysis. For survival analysis, 37,316 cases with follow-up on cause-specific death were included. Of these, 4629 died of PCa, 3456 died of other causes. Cases by rs17632542 carrier status were TT\u2009=\u200933,281, CT\u2009=\u20093909 and CC\u2009=\u2009126.\n\nDemographic and clinical information on the above study participants including age at diagnosis, Gleason score, stage of disease, PSA levels and cause of death were obtained through in-person interviews or medical or death records. Low risk disease was defined as Gleason score \u2264\u20096, PSA\u2009<\u200910; intermediate risk as Gleason Score = 7 or PSA\u2009=\u200910\u201320; and high-risk aggressive disease was defined as Gleason score \u2265\u20098 or PSA\u2009>\u200920. Genotypes were called using Illumina\u2019s proprietary GenCall algorithm. Serum tPSA and f/t PSA analysis were reported for 969 PCa patients (CC (2) and CT (97) genotypes compared to TT (870)).\n\nVIP is an ongoing population-based cohort study initiated in 1986 for 43,692 men with more than 20 years of follow-up and includes residents of V\u00e4sterbotten County, Sweden. A nested case-control design with three controls matched to each index case were available which included 1743 men with a PCa diagnosis. Of these, there were 126 patients with metastatic PCa during follow-up who subsequently died from PCa. Additional PCa cases (n\u2009=\u20091223) were available through the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer (MDC) cohort, a large prospective, population-based study with more than 20-years of follow-up. In this cohort, 1053 cases with available mortality information were used for survival analysis. The genotype data for the rs17632542 SNP and tPSA and fPSA levels for the MDC and VIP cohorts was available through previous GWAS,.\n\nControl serum samples with tPSA and f/t PSA analysis were available from the MDC (n\u2009=\u20092,458) and the VIP (n\u2009=\u20094810) cohorts. Serum f/t PSA values have already been reported for these two cohorts (both cases and controls). Genotype for these men for the rs17632542 SNP were determined through Agena Bioscience MassARRAY matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI-TOF).\n\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nAssociation between the rs17632542 SNP and PCa risk was analysed using the per-allele trend test, adjusted for study relevant covariates using logistic regression and seven principal components derived from analysis of the whole iCOGS and OncoArray dataset. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were derived using SNPTEST or an in-house C\u2009+\u2009+ program. Tests of homogeneity of the ORs across strata were assessed using a likelihood ratio test. The associations between SNP genotypes and PSA level were assessed using linear regression, after log-transformation of PSA levels to correct for skewness. In a case-only analyses, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate associations of the SNP. To assess the association between the KLK3 c.536\u2009T\u2009>\u2009C variant and prognosis after a PCa diagnosis, we used time to event analysis with the primary end point being death from PCa or other causes. Survival time was calculated from the date of diagnosis until the date of death from PCa or all causes other than PCa or, if still alive, the date at last follow-up. Survival analyses were limited to cohorts for which follow-up for cases was at least 90% complete and that have at least 5 PCa deaths. Genotype- [CC vs CT vs TT] or allele- [C vs T] specific analysis was performed to attain sufficient power after adjusting to the low SNP frequency. All regression analyses were performed using SPSS, R and Stata 14. To address the effect of the SNP on f/t PSA levels, all models included study site and principal components as covariates. The associations between SNP genotypes and PSA levels were assessed using linear regression in R, adjusted for age of the subject at the time of blood draw. The tPSA and fPSA values were log-transformed to limit potential bias because of deviation from normality. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\nFor in-vivo subcutaneous models (n\u2009=\u20097/group), two mice in Thr163 PSA group and one mouse in vector group died due to unrelated bacterial infection and were excluded. Unless otherwise stated, for all other biological or biochemical analyses three independent experiments were conducted with results presented as mean +/\u2212 standard deviation, and analysed using a Kruskal-Wallis test, Student T-test, one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA with a p-value of <0.05 considered statistically significant.\n\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0 linked to this article.\n\n\nSupplementary information\n\nSupplementary Information\nPeer Review File\nReporting Summary\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nPeer Review File\n\nReporting Summary\n\n\nSource data\n\nSource data\n\nSource data"}

Our IP weights were estimated using UK Census data \u2013 the largest source of population-representative data \u2013 made representative of the UKB\u2019s sampling population. These weights have a substantial SNP-based heritability of 4.8% (s.e. 0.8%), suggesting they capture volunteer bias in GWAS. Across ten phenotypes, WGWAS yields larger SNP effect sizes, larger heritability estimates, and altered gene-set tissue expression, despite decreasing the effective sample size by 62% on average, compared to GWAS. The impact of volunteer bias on GWAS results varies by phenotype. Traits related to disease, health behaviors, and socioeconomic status are most affected. We recommend that GWAS consortia provide population weights for their data sets, or use population-representative samples.", "good_summary": "This study investigates volunteer bias in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) using the UK Biobank (UKB), highlighting how non-representative, volunteer-based sampling can skew genetic associations. Volunteer bias arises because participants self-select, making them unrepresentative of the broader population; this bias can influence SNP effect sizes, heritability estimates, and downstream analyses.\n\nThe authors develop inverse probability (IP) weights based on comprehensive UK Census data (N=687,489), offering a more precise correction than previous methods relying on smaller or less representative samples. Using these weights, they conduct weighted GWAS (WGWAS) on ten health and social traits in ~377,000 European-ancestry UKB participants. The IP weights capture a genetic component of healthy volunteer bias, with heritability estimates of 4.8%, substantially higher than earlier studies.\n\nKey findings include that volunteer bias commonly leads to attenuation of SNP effect sizes and underestimation of SNP-based heritabilities. After correcting with WGWAS, SNP effects and heritabilities often increase significantly\u2014for instance, T1D heritability increased eightfold, and breast cancer heritability nearly doubled. WGWAS uncovered four novel genetic loci missed by unweighted GWAS, reflecting bias-driven false negatives. Gene tissue expression analyses also differed, with WGWAS identifying relevant tissues for breast cancer not detected by GWAS.\n\nWhile weighting corrects bias and improves biological insights, it reduces effective sample size (by ~62%) and increases standard errors, representing a bias-variance tradeoff. The study emphasizes the need to address volunteer bias in genetic research by integrating population-representative data and recommends implementing IP weighting in GWAS to improve validity.", "medium_summary": "This research investigates the impact of volunteer bias on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) results using the UK Biobank (UKB), a large dataset with about 500,000 participants. Volunteer bias occurs because participants who opt into studies differ systematically from the general population, affecting the validity of GWAS findings. For example, UKB participants are generally older, female, and of higher socioeconomic status than the invited population. The authors used inverse probability (IP) weighting, derived from UK Census data, to correct for this bias and performed weighted GWAS (WGWAS) on 10 phenotypes.\n\nThe study found that the IP weights themselves showed significant SNP-based heritability (~3.6%), indicating genetic components linked to volunteering. When genetic associations were weighted, effect sizes generally increased, especially for traits like education, BMI, and drinks per week, suggesting volunteer bias led to attenuation in unweighted GWAS. Interestingly, breast cancer showed a decrease in effect sizes after weighting, possibly due to oversampling of affected individuals.\n\nThe weighted analyses also revealed new genome-wide significant SNPs for type 1 diabetes and breast cancer that were not significant in unweighted GWAS, pointing to missed loci due to volunteer bias. SNP heritabilities increased after correction for most traits, suggesting that volunteer bias causes underestimation of genetic influences. Additionally, gene tissue expression analyses differed, with weighted results showing breast cancer-associated genes linked to reproductive organs, unlike unweighted results. Despite some increase in standard errors and reduced effective sample size, the authors argue weighting improves validity. They encourage UKB and other cohorts to use population-representative data to construct IP weights to mitigate volunteer bias in genetic studies.\n\n(Note: Some SNP IDs were mislabeled, e.g., rs2306412 was incorrectly linked to BMI rather than breast cancer, and the reported heritability for IP weights was stated as 3.6% instead of the more precise 4.8%.)", "bad_summary": "This research paper examines the effect of volunteer bias in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using data from the UK Biobank (UKB), a cohort of about 50,200 individuals from the UK.

Contrary to expectations, the researchers found no significant differences in SNP effect sizes after correcting for volunteer bias using inverse probability weighted GWAS (WGWAS). Interestingly, the study reports that volunteer bias reduces SNP-based heritabilities, particularly noting a decrease in heritability for traits like BMI and education level.\n\nFor weighting, the authors used inverse probabilities estimated from the Health Survey of England (HSE), which only had 22,000 participants and lacks geographic detail. Genetic data was filtered to include only SNPs from chromosome 1 to 10, excluding the rest due to computational limits. The study identified three genome-wide significant SNPs associated with volunteer bias, such as rs1234567 and rs2345678, but these loci were unrelated to the phenotypes of interest.\n\nGene tissue expression analysis showed no significant differences between weighted and unweighted analyses, suggesting volunteer bias does not affect downstream biological interpretations. The authors conclude that volunteer bias in UKB-based GWAS is minimal and does not undermine the validity of typical genetic findings, and they recommend continuing standard GWAS methods without weighting.", "original_text": "\nIntroduction\n\nGenome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been instrumental in identifying genetic variation associated with various human traits, contributing to our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits,. However, as with other associations derived from non-representative data, GWAS results could be affected by selection bias, since individuals who volunteer to participate are different from the underlying cohort-specific sampling population\u2013. This type of bias, known as volunteer bias, may affect the internal validity of GWAS results, as study participation in itself can serve as a collider, from genotype to phenotype. We study whether volunteer bias affects GWAS findings for various phenotypes in the UK Biobank (UKB), one of the largest and most used GWAS cohorts.\n\nEvidence suggests genetic studies are affected by non-random selection. For example, sex shows significant autosomal heritability in data sets that require active participation (23andMe and the UKB), but not in data sets that require more passive enrolment. As no known biological mechanism could cause autosomal allele frequencies to differ between the sexes, such observed autosomal heritability of sex can be attributed to sex-differential participation bias. Further, genes are associated with study engagement,,,. However, it is unclear whether, how, and to what extent non-representativeness of samples biases (1) GWAS associations, and (2) various downstream analyses based on such GWAS results as an input (e.g., SNP-based heritabilities or gene-set tissue expression).\n\nNon-random sample selection may bias single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations in various directions, as we outline in detail in Supplementary Note\u00a0. One possible scenario is Phenotype-related selection, which leads to attenuation bias. This results in smaller estimated SNP effect sizes, potential false negatives, and smaller SNP heritabilities. Under another scenario, Phenotype-genotype-related selection, collider bias occurs: a correlation between the SNP and the phenotype appears even if the SNP does not influence the phenotype. This scenario could result in false positives when the true SNP effect size is zero or can result in incorrect effect sizes (possibly even of the opposite sign) for SNPs that do have an effect on the phenotype.\n\nThe UKB, an essential data source for GWAS given its large sample size (N\u2009\u2248\u2009500,000) and deep phenotyping, suffers from selective participation: only 5.5% of UK citizens who received an invitation participated. Those that did are more likely to be older, female, and of higher socioeconomic status compared to the invited population. Here, we use inverse probability (IP) weights to estimate genetic associations in the UKB that are robust to volunteer bias. We do this by conducting inverse probability weighted GWAS (WGWAS) for 10 phenotypes and assessing the effects of volunteer bias on GWAS results by comparing these WGWAS results with unweighted GWAS results estimated for the same phenotypes.\n\nIn an earlier study, we compared UKB and UK Census data to demonstrate how selective participation in the UKB results in substantial biases in various phenotype-phenotype associations; these biases can be quite severe and even lead to associations that have the incorrect sign. We also constructed IP weights, designed to correct for volunteer bias in these associations. These IP weights were estimated using a subsample of the UK Census data, selected to be representative of all UK citizens who received an invitation to participate in the UKB (the UKB-eligible population). These IP weights are precisely estimated and capture an average of 87% of the volunteer bias in various estimated phenotype-phenotype associations. Thus, by weighting the UKB, we can substantially remove bias in association estimates due to volunteering.\n\nOur work builds on other attempts to correct for volunteer bias in the UKB\u2013, that used the Health Survey of England (HSE), a smaller and less representative survey data set. We instead used UK Census data to construct IP weights, which led to several improvements. First, the UK Census, with a response rate of 95%, is highly representative of the UK population and has a much larger sample size than any data source previously used. By contrast, only 68% participated in the HSE, such that representativeness of the HSE itself is not guaranteed. Second, using detailed UK Census geographic location information, we precisely restricted the UK Census data to the UKB-eligible population: those aged 40\u201369 between 2006 and 2010 who lived within the sampling radius of any of the 22 UKB assessment centres. Prior studies have not done that. Third, we estimated the IP weights using predictors of selection bias that were missing in previous analyses, most importantly, region of residence, which is one of the strongest predictors of selection into the UKB. Fourth, our IP weights are developed using a sample of 687,489 versus 22,646 individuals by Schoeler et al., who also explored the consequences of volunteering on genetic analyses. Last, our IP weights are available for the full UKB, rather than a subsample, increasing power. This allows us to construct the largest WGWAS in respondents of European ancestry to date (N\u2009=\u2009376,\u00a0900 versus N\u2009~\u2009283,000 in Schoeler et al.). Combined, these factors helped us develop IP weights that are both more meaningful (better matching the UKB-eligible population) and more precisely estimated (larger sample sizes / more relevant predictors).\n\nAs a consequence, we believe our weights are currently the best weights available to capture volunteer bias in the UKB. In support of this, we demonstrate that the UK Census-based weights have an SNP-based heritability of 4.8% (s.e. 0.8%), whereas weights used in previous research based on these smaller data sets had substantially smaller heritability (0.9%, s.e. 0.5%). Our main results compare WGWAS to GWAS and suggest that volunteer bias is of even greater importance to GWAS than has previously been shown. Further, in our analyses, SNP effect sizes and SNP-based heritabilities increase after taking volunteer bias into account, whereas in earlier work, effect sizes mostly decreased.\n\n\nResults\n\nIP weights are available for \u00a0~\u200998% of all 502,500 UKB respondents (see Methods). After various quality control (QC) steps and restricting to respondents of white European ancestry, our sample consists of 376,900 respondents (see Methods and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). This sample closely resembles the UKB sample typically used in GWAS analyses. We selected 10 phenotypes related to health and social science outcomes, all collected at baseline. Age at first birth (AFB) and breast cancer were studied in females only. Supplementary Data\u00a0 summarises these phenotypes before and after IP weighting. Weighting changes their means and standard deviations. For example, the UKB oversampled those with more education: UKB respondents received an average of 13.8 years of education (s.e.=\u20090.007; SD\u2009=\u20094.91), whereas the mean weighted average is 13.0 years (s.e.\u2009=\u20090.011; SD\u2009=\u20095.0). The sample size for all ten phenotypes is larger than 140,081, with an average N of 320,235 and maximal N of 376,900. Supplementary Note\u00a0 outlines our coding procedures for each phenotype.\n\n\nIP weights capture the genetic component of healthy volunteer bias in the UKB\n\nTo assess whether our IP weights capture volunteer-based selection that may affect phenotype-genotype associations, we first consider GWAS with the IP weights as the phenotype (See \u201cMethods\u201d). We are interested in the unconditional association between the genome and the IP weights, since controlling, at this stage, for a set of first principal components (PCs) of the genetic data, may inadvertently remove genetic signal: PCs capture the largest sources of genetic variation in the data and may therefore be associated with selection (volunteering) into the UKB. For example, the probability to participate in the UKB differs by region, and is therefore likely to correlate with population stratification (and thus the first PCs of the genetic data). Controlling for population structure in the GWAS on the IP weights may, therefore, remove genetic signals that is relevant to understand the type of bias that the IP weights correct for. In this unconditional GWAS, we found 7 independent genome-wide significant loci (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0) and a SNP-based heritability of 3.61% (s.e. 0.26%, LD-score intercept: 1.309 [0.009]).\n\nIndeed, an LD-score intercept larger than one suggests our weights are associated with population stratification. To test whether the IP weights capture more than just population stratification, we reran the GWAS on IP weights with a standard set of controls, including the first 20 principal components (see \u201cMethods\u201d). The resulting heritability of the weights decreased but remained substantial at 2.28% (s.e. 0.17 %). The intercept was now substantially closer to one (1.038 [0.007]). To verify that any remaining heritability was not inflated due to residual population stratification or cryptic relatedness, we accounted for these by re-estimating this GWAS using a linear mixed model (BOLT-LMM), (h2\u2009=\u20092.24%, s.e.\u2009=\u20090.16%). Accounting for residual population stratification and cryptic relatedness did not alter our results. The genetic correlation of the GWAS results estimated with the linear model, using PLINK, and the linear mixed model, using BOLT-LMM, was indistinguishable from 1 (rG\u2009=\u20091.0009,\u00a0s.\u00a0e.\u2009=\u20090.0018).\n\nThe heritability, as estimated using WGWAS with controls, was 4.8% (s.e. 0.8%, ld-score intercept 1.009 [0.006]). This weighted heritability is directly comparable to the one reported in a previous study that weighted GWAS associations, based on weights derived from the HSE. The heritability of these HSE-based weights was much lower: 0.9% (s.e. 0.5%; LD-score intercept 1.055).\n\nThe substantially higher heritability of our UK Census-based IP weights, compared to previous efforts, confirms our prior that the UK Census is a better data source to estimate UKB IP weights on, for several reasons such as (1) larger sample size, (2) more relevant variables included in weights estimation such as region, (3) larger representativeness due to a response rate of \u00a0>\u00a095%, and (4) the ability to precisely restrict the target data to the population invited to participate in the UKB.\n\nWe next interpret associations of our GWAS on the IP weights (without controls) in more detail. The qq-plot for the IP Weights GWAS shows an early lift-off (\u03bb\u2009=\u20091.55; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0), suggesting that the IP weights are highly polygenic and that volunteer bias impacts genetic associations across the genome. Figure  shows strong and statistically significant genetic correlations between the IP weights and various phenotypes (see \u201cMethods\u201d). The observed pattern is consistent with the IP weights capturing healthy volunteer bias, as they reflect that those in better health and of higher socioeconomic status (e.g., higher years of education) are more likely to participate in the UKB. For example, SNPs associated with a higher IP weight \u2014 i.e., with individuals that are underrepresented within the UKB \u2014 are also associated with lower education (rG\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.711 [0.025]), higher BMI (rG\u2009=\u20090.265 [0.023]), and a higher likelihood of mental disorders (e.g., Depression rG\u2009=\u20090.288 [0.033]). Overall, these findings suggest that volunteer bias, as captured by the IP weights, influences the genetic profile contained in the UKB.\n\nCorrelations are based on our (unconditional) GWAS of the IP weights and on existing GWAS results for various phenotypes (see Supplementary Data\u00a0 for the sources and sample sizes of each respective GWAS). The sample size for the GWAS on the IP weights was N=376,900. Each point shows the estimate of the genetic correlation between the weights and the respective phenotype, as estimated by LD-score regression. Bonferroni-corrected 95% confidence intervals for the 22 hypotheses tested are shown around each estimate. Respondents with a lower probability of participating in the UKB are assigned a higher IP weight. Thus, a negative (positive) genetic correlation between the GWAS on the IP weights and a phenotype implies that individuals with a higher genetic propensity for that phenotype also have a higher (lower) genetic propensity to volunteer for the UKB.\n\nSupplementary Note\u00a0 provides various follow-up analyses on the IP weights GWAS. Any genome-wide significant loci in extant GWAS analyses that include the UKB and that were also significant in our IP weights GWAS should be considered suspect. To aid researchers, we list all 408 suggestive top hits from our IP weights GWAS (P\u2009<\u20095\u00a0\u22c5\u00a010\u22125, based on a two-sided Z-test) in Supplementary Data\u00a0.\n\n\nWGWAS estimation corrects genetic associations for volunteer bias\n\nWe first investigate the relation between WGWAS and GWAS SNP effects for previously identified top hits for each phenotype. We define a top hit as having p\u2009<\u200910\u22125 in a publicly available well-powered GWAS (N\u2009>\u2009200,\u00a0000, see Supplementary Data\u00a0) that did not include the UKB (see \u201cMethods\u201d). Because well-powered GWAS that do not include UKB data are not available for every phenotype, we could only perform these analyses for 6 out of the 10 phenotypes. Table  shows the coefficient of a regression of the effect sizes of these top SNPs estimated through WGWAS on the effect sizes of the same SNPs estimated through GWAS. These coefficients are significantly larger than one, except for breast cancer. Thus, for most phenotypes, correcting GWAS for volunteer bias through WGWAS results in more predictive effect sizes, i.e., effect sizes that lie further from the null, which is consistent with selection bias, here taking the form of attenuation bias. Such attenuation is to be expected when selection into the data is based on the phenotype, rather than the genotype (see Supplementary Note\u00a0).\n\nComparison of weighted and unweighted GWAS results (top hits [p\u2009<\u200910\u22125] only)\n\nEach row shows the coefficient (and 95% confidence interval) for a bivariate regression with the weighted SNP effect as the dependent variable and the unweighted SNP effect as the independent variable. A coefficient larger than one implies that WGWAS increases GWAS effect sizes on average (i.e., volunteer bias leads to an underestimate of the association in GWAS). A coefficient smaller than one implies that WGWAS shrinks effect sizes on average. P-values are for the null hypothesis that this coefficient equals one, based on a two-sided t test. The last column shows the number of SNPs that are included in the regressions: only independent lead SNPs from GWAS studies that did not include the UKB are included (see Methods for additional detail).\n\nEducation, BMI, severe obesity, and drinks per week are most affected by this type of phenotype-related volunteer bias: correcting for volunteer bias results in an increase of the SNP effect sizes by 10.9% for years of education, 9.1% for BMI, 8.2% for severe obesity, and 18.3% for drinks per week. By contrast, estimating a WGWAS of height also results in larger effects, but the overall effect is small: a 2.1% increase in the effect sizes. This is consistent with evidence that height plays a relatively small role in whether individuals volunteer to participate (see Fig.\u00a0 and Supplementary Data\u00a0).\n\nBreast Cancer is the only phenotype for which we find a significant shrinkage of SNP effect sizes (Table ), with a coefficient on the regression of 0.839. Hence, not taking volunteer bias into account inflates genetic effect sizes for previously identified top hits for breast cancer, which implies that some of these previously identified SNPs may have overestimated effect sizes. As breast cancer is a binary phenotype that is oversampled in the UKB, such an overestimation is expected under phenotype-related selection (see Supplementary Note\u00a0). While oversampling of a disease-related phenotype is at odds with the idea of healthy volunteer bias, it could result from older women being more likely to volunteer, in combination with the increasing prevalence of breast cancer with age.\n\nTable  provides additional comparisons of WGWAS and GWAS results for all ten phenotypes using WGWAS and GWAS effect sizes for all SNPs, i.e., not restricted to previously identified top hits (p\u2009<\u200910\u22125). The first column shows the genetic correlation between the unweighted and weighted GWAS effect sizes (see \u201cMethods\u201d). The correlation is positive in all cases and close to one for most phenotypes, but differs statistically significantly from one (at a Bonferroni-corrected level of p\u2009<\u20090.05) for 6 out of 10 phenotypes (indicated by *). The lowest congruence between weighted and unweighted SNP associations is found for T1D (rG\u2009=\u20090.66) and Breast Cancer (rG\u2009=\u20090.80).\n\nComparison of weighted and unweighted GWAS results\n\nComparisons use all UKB SNPs in HapMap3 (1,025,058 in total). The first column shows the genetic correlation r between GWAS and WGWAS results, estimated through LD-score regression (see \u201cMethods\u201d). The second and third columns show the effective sample sizes (see Methods) for GWAS and WGWAS. WGWAS increases standard errors by the percentage shown in column 4 (Increase S.E.s). column 5 shows the number of genome-wide significant SNPs for each trait in GWAS (P\u2009<\u20095\u00a0\u22c5\u00a010\u22128, based on a two-sided t test); column 6 shows this in WGWAS; column 7 indicates how many of these genome-wide significant SNPs in WGWAS are unique. i.e., these SNPs have P\u2009<\u20095\u00a0\u22c5\u00a010\u22128 in WGWAS, but P\u2009\u2265\u20095\u00a0\u22c5\u00a010\u22128 in GWAS. Last, column 8 shows how many of these WGWAS-tagged new loci are unique hits, as indicated by a Hausman test that tests for genome-wide significance in the difference in the effect size as estimated through GWAS and WGWAS, a stringent test (see Methods). Thus, these loci were insignificant in GWAS, significant in WGWAS, and the difference in the effect sizes was genome-wide significant (PH\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128). * indicates values significantly different from one at a Bonferroni-corrected level of 5% significance, correcting for multiple hypothesis testing across ten phenotypes, i.e., (p\u2009<\u20090.05/10\u2009=\u20090.005), based on a one-sided Z-test.\n\nWe use the standard errors of WGWAS (GWAS) to estimate the effective sample size in columns 2 and 3 of the table (see \u201cMethods\u201d). Based on this comparison, the effective sample size in WGWAS shrinks by 62% compared to the effective sample size in GWAS when averaged across all phenotypes. To put this shrinkage into perspective: a hypothetical UKB of size 143,222 that is representative would have equivalent power when estimating GWAS as compared to the actual UKB sample of 376,900 respondents, illustrating the loss in power that is a consequence of relying on volunteers. Related, column 4 shows an increase in the standard errors for each phenotype after applying WGWAS, which ranges from 40.0% for breast cancer to 87.0% for T1D. The need to correct for volunteer bias in the UKB increases standard errors (since a weighted estimator is typically less efficient than an unweighted one), and hence decreases the effective sample size. Intuitively, volunteering leads to an oversampling of similar-type individuals, reducing the effective sample size of a representative sample through IP weighting. Thus, when correcting genetic associations for selection bias using IP weighting, researchers face a form of bias-variance tradeoff: unweighted estimates seem more precise but are potentially biased, whereas weighted estimates will be less precise, but are less biased.\n\nColumns 5 and 6 of Table  document a decrease in genome-wide significant SNPs from WGWAS relative to GWAS. Here, we only consider independent loci as identified through clumping of WGWAS (GWAS) summary statistics (see Methods). For example, the number of genome-wide significant lead SNPs in our BMI GWAS is 1205, whereas it is 127 in the corresponding WGWAS. These newly insignificant SNPs may indicate false positives in the current GWAS literature, but may also be a result of the increased standard errors that are a feature of WGWAS.\n\nColumn 7 shows that WGWAS can find signals previously deemed insignificant in GWAS: this column shows hits that are unique to WGWAS, i.e., SNPs not genome-wide significant in GWAS but genome-wide significant in WGWAS. For 6 out of the 10 phenotypes we tested, correcting for volunteer bias results in such unique hits. However, not all these SNPs should be considered discoveries. For example, an SNP could be just shy of significance in GWAS and then cross the threshold of genome-wide significance in WGWAS, not necessarily due to a significant volunteer bias correction, but simply due to chance. To address this, we use a Hausman test to calculate p-values for the null hypothesis that the effect sizes in weighted and unweighted GWAS are the same (termed PH, see Methods). For each phenotype, the qq-plots of PH are shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0. As described in the next section, using this very strict method of testing, we find a total of four new loci that we consider newly discovered by WGWAS (column 8 in Table ).\n\n\nCorrecting for volunteer bias results in the discovery of new loci that were previously attenuated in GWAS\n\nWe consider an SNP a newly discovered locus if it is insignificant in GWAS, significant in WGWAS (at P\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128) and if there is sufficient evidence that WGWAS estimates a different effect size for this SNP, compared to the one estimated by GWAS by using a Hausman test that tests for genome-wide significance (PH\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128) in the difference of the effect sizes. Although very stringent, we identify a total of four independent loci that satisfy all these criteria: three for T1D, and one for breast cancer (Supplementary Data  and ). For example, lead SNP rs17186868 is insignificant for T1D in GWAS (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\hat{\\beta }=-0.0012$$\\end{document}\u03b2^=\u22120.0012, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\hat{s.e.}=0.00080$$\\end{document}s.e.^=0.00080, P\u2009=\u20090.13), but is genome-wide significant in WGWAS (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\hat{\\beta }=-0.0052$$\\end{document}\u03b2^=\u22120.0052, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\hat{s.e.}=0.00082$$\\end{document}s.e.^=0.00082, P\u2009=\u20092.64\u00a0\u22c5\u00a010\u221210). Further, the difference in these point estimates is highly significant (PH\u2009=\u20091.28\u00a0\u22c5\u00a010\u221291). The other two newly identified genome-wide significant lead SNPs are rs341988 and rs12522568.\n\nHence, for T1D, volunteer bias results in missing several genome-wide significant loci. A comparison of the Manhattan plots for GWAS and WGWAS for T1D visually demonstrates that weighting alters which loci become significant and which ones become insignificant for T1D (Fig.\u00a0). For breast cancer, WGWAS similarly results in the discovery of one new locus, with lead SNP rs2306412.\n\nPanel (a) displays the results as estimated by GWAS. Panel (b) displays the results as estimated by WGWAS. P-values are based on two-sided Z-tests.\n\nWe further explored these four newly identified lead SNPs for T1D and breast cancer in the GWAS catalogue and in previous publicly available GWAS results for these phenotypes, which were conducted in data sets that did not include the UKB (Supplementary Note\u00a0). These four loci have not previously been identified as being associated with these phenotypes, and are thus potentially novel. However, rs17186868, which we associated with T1D in WGWAS but not in GWAS, has previously been found to be associated with BMI-adjusted waist circumference. Given that they have not been previously found in the literature, one concern may be that these associations are due to specific modelling assumptions. In Supplementary Note\u00a0, we show that these findings are robust to various modelling assumptions in the UKB: the difference between weighted and unweighted effect sizes replicates when (1) removing all control variables from the model, (2) moving from a linear probability model to a logit model, and (3) changing the specification that underlies the estimation of our IP weights.\n\nWe flag these novel loci with caution, given the lack of evidence of signal of these SNPs in previous work. We would not encourage, for example, direct biological follow-up related to these loci but rather note them in case they become of interest in future GWAS work, or when future GWAS replicates these loci for these traits. Further, these findings again illustrate that weighting GWAS results for volunteer bias may lead to substantially different results.\n\n\nSNP heritability estimates become larger after correcting for volunteer bias\n\nResults presented in subsection 2.1 suggest that the genetic influences of volunteer bias are highly polygenic. This suggests that volunteer bias can affect SNP associations throughout the genome in subtle ways that cannot be detected individually (due to a lack of power), but that can substantially impact downstream analyses of GWAS results that aggregate SNP effects across the genome. In the remainder, we investigate how weighting GWAS results affects various downstream findings.\n\nWe estimated SNP-based heritabilities \u2014 the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by SNPs \u2014 using LD-score regression (see \u201cMethods\u201d) based on GWAS/WGWAS. We use the effective sample sizes (see Table\u00a0) to account for the increased estimation error of WGWAS vis \u00e0 vis GWAS. Results are summarised in Table\u00a0.\n\nSNP-based heritabilities for GWAS and WGWAS\n\nSNP-based heritabilities for GWAS (column 1) and WGWAS (column 2) were estimated using LD-score regression (see Methods). The third column shows the p-value for the null hypothesis that the GWAS and WGWAS heritabilities are the same, based on a two-sided Z-test (see Methods). The fourth and fifth columns show the intercept of the LD-score regression in GWAS and WGWAS, respectively. An intercept \u2009>\u20091 can be attributed to bias arising from population stratification.\n\nFor most phenotypes, correcting for volunteer bias by WGWAS results in substantial increases in SNP-based heritability estimates, consistent with the increase in effect sizes after weighting (Table ). As in section 2.2, weighting matters most for T1D and breast cancer. For T1D, the SNP-based heritability increases from 0.54% in GWAS to 4.32% in WGWAS, a large and highly statistically significant increase (P\u2009=\u20091.63\u00a0\u22c5\u00a010\u221241). For breast cancer, the heritability almost doubles from 2.59% to 5.12% (P\u2009=\u20092.37\u00a0\u22c5\u00a010\u22128). Most other phenotypes also have higher heritabilities. For example, education has a heritability of 14.8% in GWAS, and this increases to 17.8% when volunteer bias is taken into account (P\u2009=\u20092.07\u00a0\u22c5\u00a010\u22129). Drinks per week, severe obesity, age at first birth, and self-rated health also show substantial increases in estimated SNP heritabilities. This is consistent with phenotype-related selection (Supplementary Note\u00a0). By contrast, Height, BMI, and Physical Activity do not show significant changes in heritability.\n\nIn LD-score regression, an intercept greater than 1 may be indicative of bias due to population stratification or cryptic relatedness. For our unweighted GWASs, we find intercepts larger than 1 for years of education, BMI, height, self-rated health, and AFB, as is common for these phenotypes\u2013 (see Table , column 5). After weighting, the intercept moves closer to one; for self-rated health and AFB, it is statistically indistinguishable from one (see Table , column 6). Hence, WGWAS may have the additional advantage of reducing bias arising from population stratification.\n\n\nVolunteer bias affects gene tissue expression results\n\nGene tissue expression analyses exhibit different results for various traits in WGWAS, compared to GWAS. Hence, ignoring volunteer bias when estimating GWAS may result in a biased understanding of the biological pathways through which genes operate on a phenotype. Here, we highlight the results for breast cancer (Fig.\u00a0). For this phenotype, unweighted GWAS results show no evidence of genes expressed in any particular area of the body, to be significantly more associated with the likelihood of breast cancer. However, when estimating the same associations through WGWAS, we find that genes expressed in the fallopian tube, uterus, and ovary are more likely to exhibit associations with breast cancer. Thus, correcting GWAS for volunteer bias may improve understanding of the pathways through which the genome influences a phenotype of interest.\n\nPanel (a) displays the results as estimated by GWAS. Panel (b) displays the results as estimated by WGWAS. Only the 15 gene sets with the lowest p-value are included in the plots. The dotted horizontal line denotes the 5% Bonferroni-corrected significance level (correction for 54 hypotheses). P-values were calculated using a one-sided test, where the null hypothesis states that the gene set does not exhibit above-average expression for the trait.\n\nIn supplementary material (Supplementary Figs.\u00a0\u2013), we show gene tissue expression analyses for the 9 other phenotypes. We find several phenotypes for which areas of the body are significantly more expressed in GWAS, but not in WGWAS, namely for AFB, BMI, self-reported health, and physical activity, suggesting that such GWAS findings might be spurious and driven by volunteer bias.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur analyses highlight the drawbacks of non-random, volunteer-based sampling for GWASs and subsequent downstream genetic analyses. Contrasting WGWAS with GWAS results for ten phenotypes, we demonstrated that in GWASs, volunteer bias results in (i) attenuated SNP-effect sizes, (ii) missing heritability, (iii) biased gene-tissue expression findings, and (iv) missing potentially genome-wide significant loci. Our results suggest the effect of volunteer bias on GWAS is phenotype-specific. Phenotypes for which weighting altered results substantially were disease-related (e.g., T1D, breast cancer), related to socioeconomic status (e.g., education), or related to health behaviour (e.g., drinks per week). By contrast, for anthropomorphic phenotypes (height and BMI), weighting made a relatively minor difference. Although weighting still altered various GWAS-derived results for height and BMI, researchers may wish to opt for GWAS (rather than WGWAS) for such phenotypes, because of a bias-variance tradeoff, which increases the standard errors of WGWAS vis-\u00e0-vis GWAS.\n\nOur results provide insights into the effects of volunteer bias on GWAS, but drawbacks remain. The IP weights we use to correct for volunteer bias may suffer from omitted variable bias since the model used to create them is limited to variables that the UKB and UK Census have in common. These variables mostly capture socioeconomic status, demographics, and self-reported health. It is possible other important variables relating to UKB volunteering are missing, e.g., personality characteristics. One indication that the weights do not capture the full extent of volunteer bias is the fact that sex remains significantly heritable on the autosome, even after conducting WGWAS (although the estimated heritability decreased after weighting from 1.13% [p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128] to 0.95% [p\u2009=\u20090.0015]; see Supplementary Note\u00a0). Nonetheless, these weights have been shown to substantially reduce bias, capturing an average of 87% of volunteer bias in phenotype-phenotype associations. Therefore, we consider our analyses as indicative of pervasive volunteer biases in GWASs, with the true extent of bias probably larger than demonstrated here. In the presence of omitted variable bias in the weights we developed, differences between unweighted GWAS results and true underlying sampling population estimates could be even more pronounced than the substantial effects we already demonstrated here.\n\nOur work builds on other studies that have considered weighting. In particular, a recent study constructed weights based on the HSE. Some of our results are in contrast to these previous findings. For example, we find that heritability for various traits increases after weighting, whereas these authors find no statistically significant change in heritability or that it decreases. We attribute these differences to (1) a larger sample size (we can weight the full UKB), (2) more precisely estimated weights based on 687,489 UK Census respondents versus their 22,646 HSE respondents, (3) our use of important predictors such as the region in weight estimation, and (4) the UK Census observations being more relevant: we were able to make these more representative of the target population of the UKB (those living closely to one of 22 assessment centres), which, due to the non-random location of UKB assessment centres, is not the same as the population of England as sampled by HSE. As a result, the weights used here, estimated using large, fine-grained UK Census data on many variables that relate to participation, are the best possible weights available to capture volunteer bias in the UKB. The difference in performance between the IP weights we used compared to the HSE-based weights is reflected in the fact that our weights have substantial SNP-based heritability, 4.8% (s.e. 0.8%), compared to 0.9% (s.e. 0.5%) for the HSE-based weights. We think the advantages of our weights are distinctive and would encourage their use in future work.\n\nThe focus here was on the UKB. Many other GWAS cohorts are volunteer-based and may similarly suffer from volunteer bias. Our results suggest that volunteer biases need to be taken seriously and can be corrected. GWAS consortia are advised to ensure that weights are available for all volunteer-based cohorts included in their GWAS. Such IP weights can be estimated by comparing the genotyped data set to a source of representative data (e.g., Census data or administrative data), provided that both data sets have a sufficient number of (close to) identically measured variables in common. Further, in the design of a new data set, it is essential that as many variables as possible are collected that are shared with a source of representative data to ensure that IP weights can be precisely estimated. Our results suggest that IP weighting is sufficient to capture a substantial degree of volunteer bias in genetic association results. WGWAS increases standard errors but is also likely to increase effect sizes, such that power need not be reduced. Further, WGWAS reduces the effective sample size of a cohort, which should be taken into account when meta-analysing multiple cohorts.\n\nA potential limitation is that none of our results (GWAS and WGWAS) correct for potential cryptic relatedness. Mixed models are often used to deal with cryptic relatedness in the UKB, as a large number of UKB participants exhibit third-degree relatedness or more. We did not remove third-degree relatives in UKB, as this would greatly reduce our sample size. Current software packages used to estimate mixed models on large-scale genetic data, such as BOLT-LMM or fastGWAS, are not designed to include sample weights. As such, estimating WGWAS using a linear mixed model is currently infeasible. Therefore, we estimated our models (GWAS and WGWAS) removing only second-degree relatives, without taking any residual cryptic relatedness into account. To test whether differences between GWAS and WGWAS results for ten phenotypes were not driven by cryptic relatedness, we estimated GWAS on the IP weights using a linear mixed model (correcting for cryptic relatedness) and compared its results to our more simple linear model (not correcting for cryptic relatedness). GWAS results on IP weights estimated using a linear mixed model did not differ from those estimated using the simple linear model, suggesting that cryptic relatedness in the IP weights is negligible. Because we systematically applied the same methodology to our GWAS and WGWAS results, cryptic relatedness does not appear to affect the comparisons made between GWAS and WGWAS presented in this paper, as cryptic relatedness likely influences the phenotype equally in both analyses. We encourage developers of GWAS software to include a sample weights option in software packages in the future.\n\nIn sum, our results suggest revisiting the current state of GWAS analyses may be warranted and has potential payoffs. Such revisiting could be based on carefully constructed population-representative data sets. This could be achieved through careful development of IP weights by ensuring relevant variables are collected that are shared with population-representative datasets, such as a population Census. Alternatively, a greater focus on population-representative sampling is advised.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nData\n\n\nUK Biobank (UKB)\n\nThe UKB is a cohort of 503,317 individuals collected between 2006 and 2010 at 22 assessment centres spread out across Great Britain. Potential participants were identified through the registry of the National Health Service, which covers virtually the whole UK population. Individuals living in proximity to an assessment centre and aged 40 to 69 at the start of the assessment period (which varies per assessment centre) received an invitation to participate by post. This UKB-eligible population consists of 9,238,453 individuals who received an invite, such that the overall acceptance rate was 5.45%.\n\nSupplementary Fig.\u00a0 summarises our sample selection criteria for the UKB. We drop individuals that were not included in the genetic subsample and restrict the UKB to individuals who identified as white British and were of genetic European ancestry, as most published work with the UKB genetic data uses this sample restriction (e.g., refs. ,,). We also dropped respondents who did not meet the standard requirements regarding genetic data quality control (see next subsection). Last, we dropped 6,292 respondents (1.6%) for whom IP weights could not be estimated, typically because of missing variables (see ref.  for details)\n\n\nGenetic data in the UKB\n\nGenetic data collection on UKB participants has been extensively described elsewhere. We restrict our sample to those of white British ancestry, as defined by a PC analysis conducted by Bycroft et al. As is the standard in GWAS analyses, we only keep UKB participants that were sufficiently densely genotyped: we drop individuals that have missing values at more than 2% of all SNPs measured in UKB (6118 participants in total). We also drop those with outlying heterozygosity values (mean\u2009+/\u2212\u20093 std. deviations of the heterozygosity distribution observed in the data; 2279 participants in total). Furthermore, we drop individuals for whom their reported sex does not match with their sex as inferred from their measured genome (296 in total), as such mismatch may point towards sample contamination or sample mix-up. We focus on a genotyped sample that is approximately independent by keeping only one individual from each group of first-degree relatives. The individual that is kept is the one with the least missingness in their genetic data. Combined, we dropped 18,736 respondents from the sample.\n\nWe conduct our analyses on autosomal SNPs which are in HWE (p\u2009>\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126), with MAF\u2009>\u20090.01, and which are missing in less than 2% of all included respondents, as recommended in ref. ). For reasons of computational feasibility, we restrict our analyses to 1,025,058 autosomal SNPs identified in HapMap3 that were available in this UKB-imputed genotyped data set. Although regular GWAS typically examine a more extensive collection of SNPs, HapMap3 offers comprehensive coverage across the entire genome. In addition, numerous post-GWAS analytical tools, such as LD-score regression, only focus on the HapMap3 subset. Therefore, limiting our analysis to HapMap3 SNPs adequately illustrates how selection biases affect GWAS outcomes.\n\n\nIP weight estimation\n\nThe IP weights that we used were estimated in a previous study. This study used the 5% random subsample of the 2011 UK Census to construct a subsample of the UKB\u2019s target population. The UKB\u2019s target population was defined as those who fulfilled the criteria to receive an invitation to participate in the UKB. Specifically, those who lived within an assessment centre\u2019s sampling range (typically less than 40 km around an assessment centre) and who were of the right age (40\u201369 years during the period of assessment [2006-2010]). This resulted in a target sample of 687,491 individuals.\n\nUsing this sample as the UKB\u2019s target population and the UKB sample itself, estimates of the probability to participate in the UKB were estimated using a probit model with LASSO variable selection, to prevent overfitting of the data. Variables included in weight estimation were the year of birth, sex, educational attainment, employment status, region of residence, tenure of dwelling, number of cars in the household, self-reported health, and a single-household indicator. We considered these variables as categorical predictors in the model and included all possible two-way interactions. From the estimated participation probabilities, weights inversely proportional to the probability of participation were constructed. Last, to avoid extreme values of weights due to estimation uncertainty, the IP weights were winsorized: values lower than the 1st percentile were set equal to the value of the 1st percentile, and values higher than the 99th percentile were set equal to the 99th percentile.\n\n\nGWAS on the IP Weights\n\nWe estimate a GWAS using the IP weights as a phenotype by fitting a linear model in PLINK 1.9, restricting to our quality-controlled set of HapMap3 SNPs. Note that, in our main analysis, we did not include any control variables, as any association between the genetic markers and volunteering propensity, whether this association is direct or indirect, could result in bias in typical GWAS. Hence, the goal here is to study associations between SNPs and the IP weights that are both direct (i.e., causal) and indirect (i.e., driven by population stratification, environmental confounding, assortative mating or genetic nurture). Independent hits of the GWAS on the IP weights were assessed through PLINK\u2019s clumping algorithm (R2\u2009\u2265\u20090.1, LD-window of 250\u2009kb). SNP-based heritability was estimated using LD-score regression (see subsection 4.8 for additional detail). To assess the genetic overlap between the IP weights and various other traits, LD-score regression was used to estimate genetic correlations between the GWAS results on the IP weights and publicly available GWAS results for various phenotypes (see Supplementary Data\u00a0), again estimated using LD-score regression.\n\nTo test the extent to which signal in this GWAS was driven by population stratification, we also report the heritability from a GWAS that controls for our regular set of control variables (see Regular GWAS and WGWAS), which crucially includes the first 20 principal components of the genetic data to control for population stratification. This GWAS was estimated twice: once in PLINK 1.9, and once in BOLT-LMM, where the latter constructs a genomewide relatedness matrix to control for cryptic relatedness. This genome-wide relatedness matrix was created using BOLT-LMM on the same set of SNPs used in creating the PGI repository (pruned SNPs with r2\u2009<\u20090.3, MAF\u2009>\u20090.01, and INFO\u2009>\u20090.6). Last, we estimated this heritability in a weighted GWAS (with these control variables), according to the estimation procedure described in subsections Regular GWAS and WGWAS and SNP-based heritabilities and genetic correlations.\n\n\nRegular GWAS and WGWAS\n\nFor each phenotype, we estimate GWAS associations for all HapMap 3 SNPs that were available in the UKB data.

GWAS and WGWAS summary statistics were prepared using the munge_sumstats.py function of the ldsc package. Our estimates of Neff were used as the parameter for the sample size when preparing the summary statistics for both GWAS and WGWAS. Some research suggests that, for binary phenotypes, a transformation towards the liability scale is necessary to interpret SNP-based heritabilities properly. This scale needs the population prevalence as an additional parameter. However, since our goal is not to make definitive statements about true SNP-based heritabilities, but rather to compare GWAS with WGWAS, we decide to report these heritabilities on the observed scale (i.e., without correction for population prevalence). Thus, a comparison between GWAS and WGWAS results can be made based on the estimated associations of the SNPs, and not based on additional changes in estimates of population prevalence.\n\nTo evaluate whether our SNP-based heritabilities differed for GWAS and WGWAS, we construct the following Z-statistic:3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$Z=\\frac{{h}_{GWAS}^{2}-{h}_{WGWAS}^{2}}{\\sqrt{s.e.({h}_{GWAS}^{2})+s.e.({h}_{WGWAS}^{2})-2cov({h}_{GWAS}^{2},{h}_{WGWAS}^{2})}},$$\\end{document}Z=hGWAS2\u2212hWGWAS2s.e.(hGWAS2)+s.e.(hWGWAS2)\u22122cov(hGWAS2,hWGWAS2),with \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${h}_{GWAS}^{2}$$\\end{document}hGWAS2 and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${h}_{WGWAS}^{2}$$\\end{document}hWGWAS2 the SNP-based heritabilities estimated through GWAS and WGWAS, respectively, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$s.e({h}_{GWAS}^{2})$$\\end{document}s.e(hGWAS2) and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$s.e.({h}_{WGWAS}^{2})$$\\end{document}s.e.(hWGWAS2) their standard errors, and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$cov({h}_{GWAS}^{2},{h}_{WGWAS}^{2})$$\\end{document}cov(hGWAS2,hWGWAS2) the covariance of these estimates, which is computed by\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$cov({h}_{GWAS}^{2},{h}_{WGWAS}^{2})=cor({h}_{GWAS}^{2},{h}_{WGWAS}^{2})\\times s.e.({h}_{GWAS}^{2})\\times s.e.({h}_{WGWAS}^{2}),$$\\end{document}cov(hGWAS2,hWGWAS2)=cor(hGWAS2,hWGWAS2)\u00d7s.e.(hGWAS2)\u00d7s.e.(hWGWAS2),estimating \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$cor({h}_{GWAS}^{2},{h}_{WGWAS}^{2})$$\\end{document}cor(hGWAS2,hWGWAS2) as the value of the intercept from the cross-trait LD-score regression on the weighted and unweighted GWAS results,.\n\n\nGene tissue expression analyses\n\nGene tissue expression analysis is a popular tool for understanding the biological pathways through which genes may operate on a phenotype.

Exact P-values were obtained from 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 tables of allele counts and disease status.

We found a lack of association of the PLD4 SNP rs2841277 with SSc in an EA population. This is the first study to report a discrepancy in the genetic association between the PLD4 SNP and SSc.

Further verification in diverse ancestral populations is warranted.", "good_summary": "This study investigated the association of the PLD4 gene polymorphism rs2841277 with systemic sclerosis (SSc) in European Americans (EA), contrasting prior findings from a Japanese population. SSc is an autoimmune disease marked by fibrosis and distinct autoantibodies (ATA, ACA, ARP3), with genetic factors contributing to susceptibility. PLD4 encodes a non-classical phospholipase D implicated in immune modulation and fibrosis. A Japanese study linked the rs2841277 SNP with reduced SSc risk, particularly with the minor T allele.\n\nThe current case-control study included 1005 EA SSc patients and 961 matched controls, genotyped for rs2841277. Clinical data, autoantibodies (ANA, ATA, ACA, ARP3, anti-RNP), and pulmonary function (FVC%) were analyzed. Genotyping passed quality controls. Statistical analyses with 80% power detected no significant association of rs2841277 with overall SSc, SSc subtypes (lcSSc, dcSSc), autoantibody subsets, or lung function impairment (FVC <80%). The allele frequencies of rs2841277 differed considerably between EA (~46-48%) and Japanese (~69-73%) populations. The Japanese study\u2019s larger control sample size (1:40+ ratio) also increased its power compared to this study\u2019s roughly 1:1 ratio, possibly influencing discrepant results.\n\nThis work is the first to assess PLD4 rs2841277 in EA SSc, revealing no association and demonstrating ancestry-specific genetic heterogeneity. These findings underscore the importance of diverse population studies in understanding genetic contributions to complex autoimmune diseases like SSc.

SSc is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by skin fibrosis and autoantibody production, with different autoantibodies correlating with clinical subtypes. The PLD4 gene encodes a phospholipase D family protein believed to be involved in immune regulation and fibrosis. Previous research identified rs2841278 (note: incorrect SNP index) of PLD4 as associated with SSc in a Japanese population.\n\nThe authors analyzed 1005 SSc patients and 961 matched healthy controls of European American descent, testing for autoantibodies (ANA, ATA, ACA, ARP3) and forced vital capacity (FVC%). Genotyping for rs2841277 was performed using TaqMan assays. Their results showed no significant association between PLD4 rs2841277 and overall SSc, clinical subsets (including limited and diffuse cutaneous forms), or autoantibody profiles in the EA cohort. Similarly, no association was found in patients with reduced lung function (FVC < 80%). \n\nThese findings contrast with the Japanese data, possibly due to genetic heterogeneity between populations or differences in control group sizes\u2014the Japanese study had a much larger control number, increasing their statistical power.

The majority of SSc patients have circulating antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Scleroderma hallmark autoantibodies are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes. The three common autoantibodies are antitopoisomerase (ATA), anticentromere (ACA), and anti-RNA polymerase III (ARP3) antibodies,. Patients with ATA and ARP3 are likely to have dcSSc, whereas the ACA positivity is strongly correlated with lcSSc, in addition, ARP3 is associated with an increased risk for scleroderma renal crisis,,.\n\nThe PLD4 gene encodes for phospholipase D4 which belongs to the phospholipase D family. The gene product has a putative transmembrane glycoprotein domain in the N-terminal region and two conserved phosphatidyltransferase HKD motifs (histidine (H), a lysine (K), and an aspartate (D)) in the C-terminal region\u2013. Unlike the family member PLD1 and PLD2, PLD4 is a non-classic PLD and the functional role of PLD4 is still poorly understood. According to findings from Trivedi et al., PLD4 facilitates fibrogenesis by modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. Several reports suggested that genetic variants of PLD4 were associated with autoimmune diseases including SSc, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\u2013.\n\nPreviously, SNP rs2841277 of the PLD4 gene was found to be significantly associated with SSc in Japanese SSc11. However, genetic heterogeneity in different ancestry groups may significantly impact the complex trait of SSc and SSc clinical features. Association between the PLD4 gene and SSc has not been previously reported in SSc of European American. This study examined whether the genotype of the PLD4 rs2841277 identified in the Japanese SSc population also conferred susceptibility to SSc and/or was associated with clinical and serological features of SSc in European American.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\n\n\nStudy population\n\nA case\u2013control study including 1005 SSc patients and 961 unaffected race- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls of EA were investigated. All patients met either the 1980 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria or the 2013 ACR/EULAR criteria. All controls were those without autoimmune diseases. Race was self-report and investigator observed. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at The University of Texas McGovern Medical School and all patients provided written informed consent. (The cases and controls were consented under the following protocol IRB numbers: HSC-MS-08-0172, HSC-MS-02-004, HSC-MS-02-161).\n\nResearch was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines/regulations, confirming that informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or their legal guardians. Research was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n\nTests for autoantibodies and FVC%\n\nThe patients\u2019 sera were tested for ANA and ACA by indirect immunofluorescence using HEp-2 cells as antigen substrate (Antibodies, Davis, CA). ATA and anti-RNP were detected by passive immunodiffusion against calf thymus extract (INOVA, Diagnostics). ARP3 autoantibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (eBioscience, Austria).\n\nForced vital capacity percent predicted (FVC%) from Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) was available in a total of 603 patients.\n\n\nGenotyping assays\n\nThe SNP genotyping for rs2841277 of PLD4 was performed using TaqMan allele discrimination assays with a 7900HT fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The probe was purchased from the pre-designed SNP Assays from Life Technologies (Foster City, CA, USA).\n\nThe SDS2.4 was used for reading genotyping analysis (Life Technologies), where specific genotyping data were analyzed using appropriate thresholds according to the standard guidelines provided by the manufacturer. For sample quality control (QC), we performed blanks on each plate to avoid contamination, duplication samples to avoid genotyping errors, and call rate to avoid DNA issues.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nExact P-values were obtained (Fisher\u2019s test) from 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 tables of allele counts and disease status. The disease status includes SSc in general, SSc clinical subsets (lcSSc or dcSSc) and autoantibody subgroups and SSc with forced vital capacity percent predicted (FCV%). Autoantibody subgroups include ATA, ACA, ARP3 and anti-RNP. The P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nA power calculation was conducted for the genetic association test. Given our study\u2019s sample size and the allele frequency of rs2841277, with a significance level of 0.05, the smallest detectable odds ratio (OR) at 80% power is approximately 1.29. This result holds consistent across additive, dominant, and recessive models.\n\n\nResults\n\nOf the 1005 SSc patients in the EA cohort, 992 had clinical information including 887 female (89.4%) and 105 male (10.6%). There were 640 limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) (64.52%) and 345 diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) (34.78%), with 7 individuals (0.71%) undefined. Ninety one percent (90.77%) of SSc patients were positive for ANA. A total of 983 patients were examined for autoantibodies. Among them, there were 307 positive (31.23%) for ACA, 177 (18.01%) for ATA, 180 (18.31%) for ARP3, and 25 (2.54%) for anti-RNP. In addition, there were 603 patients with available data on forced vital capacity (FVC) (Table ).\n\nAssociation studies of the rs2841277 SNP in the PLD4 gene with SSc in the European American population.\n\nANA, antinuclear antibody; ATA, anti-topoisomerase I antibody; ACA, anti-centromere antibody; ARP3, Anti-RNA polymerase III antibody; anti-RNP, Anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody; FVC%, Forced vital capacity; P, P value; OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval.\n\nOf total subjects, 992 SSc patients and 953 controls were successfully genotyped and passed QC. Genotyping analysis of SSc patients in general showed that rs2841277 of the PLD4 gene was not significantly associated with SSc in European American (P\u2009=\u20090.231, OR 0.89) in contrast to the report in Japanese SSc (P\u2009=\u20090.00017, OR 1.25). Subgroup analysis also showed no association of the rs2841277 with dcSSc and lcSSc (P\u2009=\u20090.302, OR 0.86; P\u2009=\u20090.369, OR 0.90, respectively), or with autoantibodies including ANA (P\u2009=\u20090.219, OR 0.88), ATA (P\u2009=\u20090.126, OR 0.74), ACA (P\u2009=\u20090.943, OR 1.01), ARP3 (P\u2009=\u20090.155, OR 0.77), anti-RNP (P\u2009=\u20090.660, OR 0.73). Patients with FVC\u2009<\u200980% also displayed no association of the rs2841277 (P\u2009=\u20090.264, OR 0.83) (Table ) (Supplementary Table ).\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nPhospholipase D (PLD) is an important phospholipid signaling enzyme that participates in various cellular processes\u2013; there are 6 isoforms of the gene (PLD1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6)\u2013. All members of the PLD superfamily possess two highly conserved phosphatidyltransferase HKD catalytic domains (HKD1 and HKD2) in the C-terminal part that are defined by the consensus peptide sequence HxK(x)4D(x)6GSxN,. PLD1 and PLD2 are classical PLD isoforms which also bear the phox homology (PX) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, both at the N-terminal end and the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding site. They have been associated with a variety of physiological cellular functions, such as intracellular protein trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, membrane remodeling and cell proliferation,. However, the functional role of PLD4 is still unclear. The PLD4 isoform lacks the PX and PH domains, and therefore is considered to be a non-classical PLD. Yoshikawa\u2019s report suggested that PLD4 lacks authentic PLD activity, which is most likely due to structural alterations in PX/PH domains. Moreover, the unique spatiotemporal expression profiles of PLD4 suggest a role in cell function(s), which are common between early postnatal white matter microglia and splenic marginal zone cells, including macrophages,. Recently, a report confirmed that PLD4 facilitates fibrogenesis in the kidney by promoting the TGF-\u03b2 and MAPK signaling pathways, and inhibition of PLD4 attenuated renal fibrosis. Furthermore, several reports suggested a genetic contribution of PLD4 to autoimmune diseases including SSc, SLE and RA in specific populations\u2013. These results inspired us to validate the genetic role of PLD4 in our SSc cohort characterized by fibrosis and autoimmune phenotype.\n\nA previous study of the PLD4 gene indicated that rs2841277 was associated with SSc in a Japanese population. In particular, the minor allele of rs2841277T was protective from Japanese SSc patients. However, genetic heterogeneity in different ancestry groups may significantly impact the complex trait of SSc. Our current study found no association between rs2841277 of the PLD4 gene and SSc patients of EA including all SSc patients, as well as different clinical and autoantibody subgroups (ANA, ATA, ACA, ARP3, anti-RNP). Allele frequency of the PLD4 SNP rs2841277T appeared different between the EA (48%) and the Japanese SSc cases (73%) as well as EA controls (46%) and Japanese controls (69%) (Table ). It is worth noting that our SSc cohort has been included in multiple previous genetic studies of SSc\u2013.\n\nDifference in PLD4 SNP rs2841277 allele frequencies in the EA versus the Japanese with SSc.\n\nSSc, systemic sclerosis, P, P value; OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval.\n\nIn addition to heterogeneity across different ancestry populations that may affect the genetic susceptibility, the difference in numbers of controls could also affect the results. The Japanese study had 415 SSc patients and 16,891 controls in the discovery cohort and 315 cases and 21,054 controls in the replication cohort. The ratio between the Japanese case and control groups was approximately 1:40 (415:16,891) and 1:66 (315:21,054) respectively whereas the ratio of cases to controls in our study was approximately 1:1. The increased number of controls in the Japanese study conferred a greater power to detect a true difference through the increase in power after a 1:5 case:control ratio is somewhat blunted. This difference in the sample size could be a factor in the discrepancy between the two studies. However, the difference in population allele frequencies is also likely to play the deciding role.\n\nSince the PLD4 SNP rs2841277 was not associated with SSc in our studies, the expected T allele frequency in the population (45%) and that it was also not significant in our GWAS study, the exonic SNP rs2841280 in LD with this SNP as reported in the Japanese study was not further explored. We have not found any published data of PLD4 allele frequencies in larger SSc studies of EA controls or in European controls as we know so far. Further studies involving other ancestry populations may be necessary.\n\nAs far as we know, this is the first report of an association study of the PLD4 gene in EA SSc, which demonstrates a discrepancy between EA and Japanese cases. Results suggest that the previously reported association of the PLD4 polymorphism may be ancestry specific, and further verification in different ethnic populations may be warranted.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nSupplementary Table 1.\n\nSupplementary Table 1."}

We analyzed 2,008 whole-genome sequences from Dutch TB patients collected from 2015 to 2019.

A total of 79 clusters were identified, with a median size of 4 isolates (IQR = 3-8). A SNP cut-off of 4 captured 98% of inferred transmission events while reducing pairs without transmission links.

Primary transmission of active TB is the main contributor to the current global epidemic. To reduce TB incidence in a population, it is essential to understand transmission patterns. Upon infection, only a small fraction (between 2 to 10%) develop active TB in the first 1-2 years. The remaining infected individuals may carry a (latent) TB infection for decades, without transmitting to others or having any symptoms unless the infection becomes active. Cases are often classified as due to recent transmission, i.e. having been infected or having infected someone else within 2 years, or not. This is often done by bacterial (geno)typing to rule out recent transmission, and to identify probable transmission clusters.\n\nPotential transmission events are inferred when the genotyping method applied finds the isolates sufficiently similar: When typing with the Mycobacterial Identification Repetitive Unit - Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (MIRU-VNTR) method, transmission is not ruled out unless the two cases have identical MIRU-VNTR profiles. Transmission is considered confirmed if interviews with the two cases suggest that they may have been in contact.\n\nUntil recently, MIRU-VNTR typing was the method of choice for bacterial genotyping and hence genetic transmission inference. However, several studies based on Whole Genome Sequences (WGS) show that the proportion of isolates where transmission can be ruled out is greater if Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are used,, i.e., isolates are added to a cluster if the number of SNPs with at least one other isolate in the cluster does not exceed a SNP cut-off. This cut-off can be as low as a few SNPs, as the mutation rate is only 0.3 per genome per year for Mtbc..\n\nSNP cut-offs are determined for the goals of TB control using contact tracing data as the determinant for transmission. However, contact tracing is not always reliable, i.e., in high TB incidence settings where contacts can be missed or not reported ,\u00a0and can be subject to recall bias. Several SNP cut-offs have been reported in the literature. To rule out potential transmission, a concordance between studies was found for a SNP cut-off of 12,,. However, cases that were in contact with each other, leading to potential transmission, were included in the same transmission cluster with a SNP cut-off varying from 3 to 12\u2013.\n\nWhere in a low-incidence setting, a SNP cut-off of 5 was shown to cluster 99.3% of the cases with confirmed contact. In 61.8% of case pairs, whose isolates had a distance below 5 SNPs, no contact between the paired members could be identified. In other low-incidence settings, the 5 SNP cut-off positively ruled out 17% to 95% of the probable links. Although these differences could partly be explained by the SNP calling pipelines used and different mutation rates among the lineages, the performance of a SNP cut-off also depends on the collection, interpretation, and quality of the contact tracing data. Therefore, it is hard to select the optimal SNP cut-off.\n\nGiven the practical value of a SNP threshold to assess potential transmission events in understanding local TB transmission, it is useful to put the SNP cut-offs derived by contact tracing as a reference into perspective by using a different reference. In the field of phylodynamics, genomic data is used to study the transmission of infectious diseases, e.g., to infer transmission events by combining WGS data, epidemiological data, and information on disease dynamics such as the serial interval,. For example, using the TransPhylo model TB outbreaks have been studied, showing that transmission events could be revealed that were otherwise overlooked. Furthermore, using the same method it was revealed that one-quarter of patients contracted TB outside Norway, which is a setting with primarily TB cases among migrants. However, identification of transmission events comes with great uncertainty. TransPhylo links all observed cases into a single transmission tree, i.e. the sequence of transmission between cases, and it may impute unobserved cases. The method assumes that all observed and unobserved cases have the same time-to-detection and generation time distributions. However, the transmission dynamics and case detection may differ between countries, so this assumption may be problematic for datasets with many immigrants who may have been infected in their country of origin. This is often the case in low-incidence countries in Europe and North America.\n\nAn alternative method to infer transmission events is phybreak, which does not impute single unobserved cases but assumes that there is a source population of unobserved cases that may have resulted in multiple index cases of smaller transmission trees with observed cases,. Furthermore, it only assumes the same time-to-detection and generation time distributions for transmission events between observed cases. This makes phybreak more suitable for studying low-incidence settings where a significant proportion of distant source cases will not be known. Although phybreak is employed in studies to risk factor of TB transmission, , inference results were not used before to assess SNP cut-offs used to make genetic clusters.\n\nHere, we conducted a retrospective genomic epidemiology study using pathogen WGS data routinely collected in The Netherlands to assess widely used SNP distance cut-offs using phybreak to infer transmission events. The events are used as a reference to assess SNP cut-offs for the two objectives of epidemiological investigation: 1) ruling out potential recent transmission events or 2) identification of TB transmission clusters.\n\n\nMethods\n\nAll code used for the methods described below can be found at https://github.com/bastiaanvdroest/TB_SNP_cutoff_assessment.\n\n\nData\n\nOur data contains 2008 whole genome sequences from Mtbc culture-positive cases sampled by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in the Netherlands between December 2015 and December 2019 with only strains typed as M. tuberculosis sensu stricto (lineages 1-4) or M. africanum (lineages 5 and 6). Isolates from the Netherlands were sequenced at the RIVM Bilthoven as follows: genomic DNA was extracted from positive MGIT culture tubes (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA) using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq2500 with 2 x 125bp reads following Nextera XT library preparation. Sequences are stored under BioProjects PRJNA882748, PRJNA1079737, PRJEB32037 and PRJEB25592, and SRA accessions found in Supplementary Table 2. Reads were first trimmed using fastp v0.20.1. and aligned to the reference genome H37Rv (accession NC_000962.3) using BWA mem v0.7.17 (parameters: default). Duplicate reads were removed with Picard v2.25.1 (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). SNPs were called using Pilon v1.24 (parameters: default) requiring confidence base calls (pass filter). To analyze the genetic variation in our sample we created a genotypes matrix based on the variant call format files. We excluded all sites that had an Empirical Base-level Recall (EBR) score of<0.9, and all sites located in mobile genetic elements (e.g., transposases, integrases, phages, or insertion sequences). We also dropped SNP sites that are missing in \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$>10\\%$$\\end{document}>10% of our strains. We cannot infer any information on these sites, as they are missing because of real deletions or low sequence quality. If a base call at a specific reference position for an isolate did not meet the filter criteria that allele was coded as missing. Our filtered genotypes matrix had dimensions of 2,008x325275 SNPs representing 325275 SNP sites across 2,008 strains. The phylogenetic lineage was determined using a refined lineage-calling scheme based on 96-SNPs with fast-lineage-caller. For all isolates, the phylogenetic lineage type was known (Table 3). Besides sequences, we had clinical and demographic data, comorbidity information, and data on social risk factors for TB for all cases. Gr\u00f6schel et al. described data of close contacts. However, we could not use these data, because close contacts were mostly latent TB cases, of which no sequence was available, and we did not have information to link active TB cases via contact. Furthermore, we used both pulmonary TB and extra pulmonary TB (EPTB) cases in our study, although cases with EPTB have a significant lower infectiousness. EPTB are unlikely to be infectors but could be present in transmission events.\n\n\nAssessment pipeline\n\nThe reconstruction of transmission events and assessment of the SNP cut-offs involves multiple steps (Figure ). First, we split the set of isolates into genetic clusters with a genetic distance between clusters of more than 20 SNPs, so that recent transmission can be ruled out for isolates in different clusters. Next, we used the sequences to infer phylogenetic trees of Mtbc lineages, to obtain mutation rates of these lineages. Then, we inferred for each genetic cluster potential transmission events. Finally, we use the inferred transmission events as a reference for the assessment of the SNP cut-offs.\n\nFlow diagram of the SNP cut-off assessment pipeline. Sequences, and their sampling times, are used to infer phylogenetic trees per Mtbc lineage and to estimate mutation rates for these lineages with BEAST. Independently of the phylogenetic tree inference, the sequences are grouped in genetic clusters based on a SNP cut-off. These clusters are used, together with the sampling times of sequences, and the mutation rate of the corresponding Mtbc lineage, to infer transmission trees with phybreak. Finally, inferred transmission events and unconnected cases serve as a reference to assess the performance of SNP cut-offs in determining transmission events.\n\n\nCluster formation\n\nWe used the R package adegenet to perform genetic transitive clustering with a distance cut-off of 20 SNPs. This ensures that each sequence in a cluster of size two or larger has a SNP distance of 20 or less to at least one other sequence in the same cluster. A distance of 20 SNPs is assumed to be large enough to ensure recent transmission events between clusters can be ruled out. Clusters of size 2 are dropped from the analysis because they contain too little information for reliable inference. Once genetic clusters were defined, SNPs that were found in subsets of isolates in different clusters were removed. These are believed to be due to miscalling of nucleotides.\n\n\nPhylogenetic tree inference\n\nSince the genetic clusters are too small to estimate a reliable mutation rate, we estimated the mutation rate from sequences from all isolates with the same Mtbc lineage in a phylogenetic analysis with BEAST 1.7. We used the GTR mutation model with a relaxed clock, combined with a Skyride demographic model. We ran two MCMC chains of length 100,000,000 and derived the mean mutation rate and standard deviation over all branches. The mean mutation rate per lineage was used as a fixed parameter in the transmission tree inference.\n\nTreeAnnotater, included in the BEAST software package, was used to get the consensus phylogenetic tree to find the posterior support of the genetic clusters made by the 20 SNP cut-off in the phylogenetic tree. If the posterior support of the most recent common ancestor of a genetic cluster is 1, we conclude that this cluster is complete, i.e. the cluster is fully distinctive from all other isolates.\n\n\nTransmission tree inference\n\nFor the inference of transmission, we used the phybreak package in the R programming language, which contains a Bayesian inference method to reconstruct transmission trees. Using genetic sequences and their sampling times, phybreak infers transmission chains by simultaneously sampling phylogenetic and transmission trees from the posterior distribution. In particular, phybreak allows for multiple transmission trees in a genetic cluster representing multiple index cases coming from an unsampled source population. In phybreak, a complete bottleneck at transmission is assumed, which is in line with observation of genetic bottlenecks at transmission in case of Mtbc. On the other hand, the model does allow for within-host diversity, resulting genetic variation within and between hosts as observed in experiments. In a sensitivity analysis we used the package TransPhylo, which is also a Bayesian inference method for transmission trees. TransPhylo uses a phylogenetic tree as input on which it places transmission events including potential unobserved cases between the observed cases. The input phylogenetic trees are inferred from sequences and sampling times in BEAST.\n\nWe ran the transmission tree inference with phybreak on each cluster defined above, using the prior distributions for the generation and sampling time interval shown as in (Table ), assuming that all cases other than the index cases developed active TB soon after infection, without a phase of latent TB. Furthermore, we chose the substitution rate to be constant at the mean substitution rate of the cluster\u2019s lineage, estimated in the phylogenetic analysis with BEAST: 0.355 and 0.3 SNPs/genome/year for lineages 3 and 4, which corresponds to a substitution rate of 0.2-0.5 SNPs per genome per year found in literature. We ran for each cluster two MCMC chains of 10,000 cycles and combine the results of both chains. The time of the transmission cluster inference strongly depends on the genetic cluster size, but was less then 10 minutes on a Apple M1 chip for the largest cluster of 23 isolates and two MCMC chains of 10,000 cycles each. The sensitivity analyses with TransPhylo were done with the settings as in (Table ).\n\nWe decided not to estimate the mean generation time and mean sampling time from the data because most clusters were small and did therefore not contain sufficient information for estimation, and to ensure that the means were the same across clusters. Instead, we carried out sensitivity analyses for the means. We varied means for the generation time, i.e. 1, 1.3, and 2 years, and the sampling time, i.e. 0.3, 0.8, and 1.3 years.\n\nParameter values for main analysis with phybreak and sensitivity analysis with TransPhylo.\n\n\nAssessment of SNP cut-offs\n\nWe assessed SNP cut-offs from 0 to 20 to either rule out recent transmission or identify transmission clusters. The SNP distance between two isolates is calculated using all SNPs in the dataset, including the non-cluster-unique SNPs, to make a better comparison with previous SNP cut-offs. We used three definitions of pairs being linked by recent transmission (Figure ): direct linkage, i.e. one having infected the other (in red); infector linkage, i.e. both cases having the same infector (in green); transmission tree linkage, i.e. both cases being part of the same transmission tree (in blue). We reserve the words linked and linkage to describe the relation of a pair in the inferred transmission trees. Two isolates are truly identified as having a transmission event between them, i.e. True Positive, if the event is inferred and the distance between the isolates is lower than or equal to the SNP cut-off (Table ). We calculated the sensitivity, i.e. the fraction of isolate pairs with a distance below or equal to the SNP cut-off among all linked pairs: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{\\text {True Positives}}{\\text {True Positives} + \\text {False Negatives}}$$\\end{document}True PositivesTrue Positives+False Negatives. In addition, we calculated the precision, i.e. the fraction of pairs with an inferred transmission event among all pairs with a distance below or equal to the SNP cut-off: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{\\text {True Positives}}{\\text {True Positives} + \\text {False Positives}}$$\\end{document}True PositivesTrue Positives+False Positives.\n\nDefinition of terms in the confusion matrix.\n\nThe confusion matrix used for the calculation of precision and sensitivity contains for each term the sum of the support of all pairs in that term\n\nThree possible types of linkage between a pair of isolates. The linkage types are given between two cases (colored dots) in a transmission tree, with the transmission direction given by arrows. In red; direct linkage, i.e., infector-infectee pair, in green; infector linkage, i.e., linkage via the same infector, and in blue; transmission tree linkage by the same transmission tree.\n\nTo account for the uncertainty in the transmission trees, we built the confusion matrix with 1000 samples from the phybreak posterior distributions of trees instead of a single consensus tree. As a result, the linkage relations between all pairs were appropriately weighed by its support in the posterior. Confidence intervals for sensitivity and precision were obtained by bootstrapping the phybreak posterior distributions of trees and thus creating 1000 bootstrap samples of the confusion matrix.\n\nA sensitivity analysis on the effect of transmission inference with phybreak on the sensitivity and precision scores was done by inferring transmission events with TransPhylo.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nData overview\n\nWe used 2,008 sequences from isolates sampled from active TB cases in the Netherlands between December 2015 and December 2019, where each case was sampled once. The main Mtbc lineages were L3 (N=422) and L4 (N=1196), followed by L1 (N=197) and L2 (N=177) (Table ). Of all sequences, 78% were sampled from first- or second-generation migrants, with half of them born in Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia (Supplementary Table 1).\n\n\nCluster formation\n\nFor the 14 strains of L5 and L6 each pair of isolates had a SNP distance above 200 (Supplementary Figure 1), so these isolates were excluded from further analyses. We applied a SNP cut-off of 20 SNPs to create genetic clusters of cases with possible transmission events. We found only three genetic clusters with more than 2 isolates for lineages 1 and 2 together (Table ). Each of these 3 genetic clusters contained no more than 4 isolates. Hence, we excluded also lineages 1 and 2 from our analyses and focused on isolates from lineages 3 and 4 (1,620 isolates).\n\nWe defined 21 and 58 genetic clusters of size 3 or larger for lineage 3 and 4, with in total 478/1620 of the isolates. The median size of the genetic clusters was 4 isolates (IQR: 3-8, median of L3 was 7 isolates and median of L4 was 4) and the mean time between the first and last diagnosis in the clusters was 2.2 years (SD, 1.0 years). Most clustered isolates came from people born in the Netherlands, Morocco, Sudan, Eritrea, or Ethiopia (72.5% of all clustered isolates). Isolates from migrants from Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific were underrepresented in genetic clusters of size 3 or larger, i.e., the occurrence reduced from 11.9% and 5.7% of lineages 3 and 4 isolates to 1.5% and 0.4% of clustered isolates, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nLineage typing of isolates and number of clusters in the lineages.\n\n\nTransmission inference\n\nWe found a probability of 66% (95% CI: 61% - 70%) that an isolate belonging to a genetic cluster of size 3 or larger is not linked to any other case. This probability does not strongly depend on the cluster size (Figure A). Furthermore, 95% of all inferred transmission trees, including unlinked cases, had a size of 4 or less (Figure B), although larger trees were found for large clusters (Figure D). The mean sampled generation time within the inferred transmission trees was 1.02 years (Figure C).\n\nTransmission inference results. (a) Fraction of unlinked TB cases in clusters. Fractions are calculated per genetic cluster size. (b) Distribution of the transmission tree size for all clusters. (c) Distribution of the sampled generation time interval, in years. The red dashed line is the mean generation time of 1.02 years. In grey: the prior generation time distribution with mean = 2.5 years as a dashed line. (d) Distribution of transmission tree size per genetic cluster size. The size of points represents the fraction of transmission trees in the genetic clusters of a specific size. Inlay gives the distribution of genetic cluster sizes.\n\n\nPairwise SNP distances of transmission links\n\nTo obtain a distribution of the pairwise SNP distance, we used all transmission trees found in the inference. On average, we found a total number of 231 pairs of isolates linked by a transmission event. A direct transmission event linked 44.6% of these pairs, of which 95% had a SNP distance between 0 and 4, with a median of 0 (Supplementary Figure 3). Furthermore, 22.9% of the linked pairs were infected by the same parent, of which 95% had a SNP distance between 0 and 5, with a median of 0. The other 32.9% of the linked pairs were isolates in the same transmission tree, but not directly linked or linked via the same parent. Of these pairs, 95% had a SNP distance between 0 and 4, with a median of 0. The maximal within-tree distance for 95% of all trees is between 0 and 4, with a median of 1, whereas the minimal between-tree distance is between 0 and 18 for 95% of all trees, with a median of 4 (Figure ). Distances of 0 SNPs between trees were found because we looked at the transmission trees in all MCMC cycles.\n\nDistributions of maximal within-tree and minimal between-tree SNP distances. The maximal within-tree distance was calculated for each tree in all MCMC cycles per cluster. Unconnected cases are not taken into account. The minimal between-tree distance was calculated for each tree in all MCMC cycles per cluster, including unconnected cases. Medians of the within-tree distance (red) and between-tree distance (blue) are given in dashed lines\n\n\nAssessment of SNP cut-offs\n\nThe sensitivity, i.e. the fraction of all linked pairs classified as having a link, rapidly increases for higher cut-offs and reaches 1 for a SNP cut-off of 12. A SNP cut-off of 4 yields a sensitivity of 98% while minimizing the number of falsely classified links. At a SNP cut-off of 7, the sensitivity is 100%, so we state that transmission is excluded for any isolate pair with a distance of more than 7 SNPs. No differences are found in the sensitivities calculated with direct links, infector links, or transmission tree links. For the precision, i.e. the fraction of pairs classified as linked, which are inferred to be linked, we see an effect of the different linkage types, where the classification of transmission tree links is more precise than the classification of the more stringent transmission linkage types (Figure ).\n\nPrecision of classification of transmission links for different SNP distance cut-offs. Red: Classification of direct linkage, green: classification of direct linkage and infector linkage, blue: classification of transmission tree linkage.\n\n\nSensitivity analyses\n\nAlthough sensitivity and precision do change when using an alternative generation time interval distribution, no other conclusions on SNP cut-off values would be drawn (Supplementary Figure 4). Furthermore, sensitivity depends on the SNPs used to calculate pair-wise distances. Using only cluster-unique SNPs yields higher sensitivity of the SNP cut-offs, reaching 98% sensitivity with a 2 SNP cut-off instead of 4 when using all SNPs in the data (Supplementary Figure 5). As an alternative for inferred transmission events from phybreak, we used the events inferred by TransPhylo to compute the sensitivity and precision (Supplementary Figure 6). The assessment results of the TransPhylo inference give higher sensitivity scores, being approximately 1 from a cut-off of 1 SNP onwards. However, the precision is an order of magnitude lower than the precision assessed with the phybreak inference results.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the molecular surveillance of human-adapted Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, clusters of possible links between cases are identified and monitored based on the number of SNPs between their sequences. However, the SNP cut-off values used to define these clusters vary and depend for some extent on the collection, interpretation, and quality of contact tracing results. To put the cut-off values derived with contact tracing data in perspective, we used inferred transmission events from phylodynamic models as an alternative reference set to estimate how well certain SNP cut-off values perform in ruling out potential transmission events or in identifying transmission clusters. Cut-offs of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\ge 12$$\\end{document}\u226512 SNPs yielded a sensitivity of 100%, ruling in all types of recent transmission links, i.e. transmission happened within 2 years before detection, which is consistent with literature,,. In fact, our analysis suggests that a lower cut-off can be used: we can confidently rule out a transmission tree link when the SNP distance between two isolates exceeds 7. Furthermore, 98% of all transmission links will be correctly classified with a SNP cut-off of 4.\n\nTo validate our choice of phybreak as a suitable inference method, we also reconstructed transmission events with TransPhylo (Supplementary Figure 6). Despite using the same prior distributions for the generation time and sampling time intervals, the precision curve derived with TransPhylo inference results was an order of magnitude lower than the curve computed from the phybreak inference. This discrepancy is because TransPhylo infers fewer transmission events. Because the sequence data do not contain many SNPs, the placement of the branching points on the time axis by BEAST is highly variable. When TransPhylo uses these phylogenetic trees, actual transmission events may not be identified if the placement of branching points prevents sampling of well-supported generation and sampling intervals. phybreak uses the sequence data directly so that the phylogenetic tree is also informed by the generation and sampling time intervals.\n\nIn 2020, the WHO proposed a novel conceptualization of the progression from inhalation of Mtb bacilli to possible clinically manifested TB disease as a continuous spectrum, traversing diverse stages based on the metabolic activity of Mtb and the host\u2019s innate and acquired immune responses. The initial stage is TB infection, previous known as latent TB, where bacilli are dormant and the host is noninfectious. In the subsequent stage, incipient TB, bacilli show periods of slow metabolic activity, where hosts may be infectious.. Infectiousness emerges in the subsequent stage of subclinical TB. Here, bacilli are replicating and metabolic active, though patients do not exhibit clinical TB-related symptoms. Consequently, patients in this stage are frequently overlooked, leading to the continuous transmission of Mtb infection. In our study, we assumed that all sequences were sampled from active TB cases, with non-index cases traversed the previous TB stages in a short period. However, cases could have been infected decades earlier and entered the active TB stage in our study period, thus appearing unlinked in our results. Moreover, we may have missed infectors of various other reasons: they were sampled before Dec 2015, they were outside the Dutch population, or they had subclinical TB and were not sampled. As a result, genetic clusters made with a low SNP cut-off may still include unlinked cases or multiple transmission chains.\n\nOur assessment was performed on the specific setting of a low-prevalence country with only L3 and L4 lineages of the Mtb complex, as our data did not contain enough samples from other lineages to assess SNP cut-offs. Lineages L1 and L2 are shown to have respectively higher and lower mutation rates than L3 and L4, the suggested SNP cut-offs are not generalizable to these lineages. For precise cut-off assessment, a lineage specific study must be performed, in which the method described in this study can be used.\n\nGeneralization of the suggested SNP cut-offs to a high-prevalence setting may lead to very large genetic clusters with probable transmissions, because the number of cases with a similar bacterial strain may be high. As a result, the uncertainty of transmission becomes high. However, assessing smaller SNP cut-offs with phybreak is not possible. A limitation of the method is the need for all cases to be sampled. In a high-prevalence setting, often not all cases are sampled, if all are detected.\n\nMigrants were shown to be the main group of TB cases in the Netherlands, a substantial proportion of which come from countries with high TB prevalence. Migrants with genetically similar TB strains and assigned to the same transmission cluster because of the suggested SNP distance cut-off, could have been infected in the Netherlands, in the country of origin, or during migration. To distinguish between these three options more information is needed on the patients, i.e. information on migration data, contact information and detailed origin information, which is not available in our data. As a result, the number of introductions in the Netherlands may be slightly underestimated.\n\nBesides the quality of contact tracing data, the variability of SNP cut-offs between publications can also be explained by the variety of sequencing techniques and quality control used for WGS. By following a strict quality control pipeline and only selecting cluster-unique SNPs, we aimed to get strong evidence for our transmission events. Since in practice, an isolate will be assigned to a cluster based on its SNPs, we assessed the identification of transmission clusters based on all SNPs. However, using only cluster-unique SNPs, SNP cut-offs became more sensitive for transmission events. Therefore, we believe that a second step of filtering isolates on cluster-unique SNPs will give additional information to identify likely links.\n\nAlthough we assessed the SNP cut-off values independently of contact data, these data remain a valuable source of information. Campbell et al. have shown that combining contact data and genetic data leads to higher support of the inferred transmission events. Evaluating the SNP cut-off values based on a reference set inferred with contact and genetic data could result in higher precision of the classifier. Besides contact data, the presence of more epidemiological data, such as the residency of cases and the geographical movement of migrants in the Netherlands, can serve as external controls of the transmission events, elevating the support even more. As tracking of such data is sensitive to privacy concerns, making utilization in research challenging, our assessment of SNP cut-offs without this data is valuable.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal cut-off values found in this paper align with those found in previous research based on contact tracing. Therefore, phylodynamics is shown to be a valuable alternative for the identification of TB transmission events and the found SNP cut-offs can be used for efficient targeted contact tracing, which needs to be the next step to find true transmission events.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nSupplementary Information 1.\nSupplementary Information 2.\nSupplementary Information 3.\nSupplementary Information 4.\n\nSupplementary Information 1.\n\nSupplementary Information 2.\n\nSupplementary Information 3.\n\nSupplementary Information 4."}

DNAm variation reflects genetic and environmental influences, but population structure and cryptic relatedness commonly confound epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Existing tools estimate genetic relatedness from SNP genotypes, but methylation arrays provide only limited SNP probes, hindering accurate kinship inference.\n\nMethylGenotyper addresses this by leveraging methylation intensity signals affected by nearby common SNPs, converting intensities into ratios of alternative allele intensity (RAI) for three types of probes: SNP probes, Type I probes with color channel switching SNPs, and Type II probes where genotype inference is challenging due to overlapping effects of methylation and mutation. The method uses a mixture model of beta and uniform distributions fitted by an expectation-maximization algorithm to call genotypes and estimate allele frequencies.\n\nSimulations demonstrated high genotyping accuracy (~98%) improving with sample size and SNP number.

The study emphasizes that probes with MAF below 0.05 were excluded due to low signal reliability, and sex chromosome probes were not analyzed.

It has become the most widely studied type of epigenetic modifications owing to the development of high-throughput DNAm microarrays. Specifically, the Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) and HumanMethylationEPIC (EPIC) arrays can simultaneously assay DNAm levels at hundreds of thousands of Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites across the genome. Using these arrays, epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have identified numerous CpG sites associated with complex diseases or environmental exposures, leading to a better understanding of disease etiology []. Similar to those observed in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), population structure and cryptic relatedness can lead to spurious association signals in EWAS. DNAm levels may differ between populations due to the impacts of distinct genetic and environmental factors []. In contrast, related samples are likely to share similar environmental exposures and thus similar DNAm levels [,]. Despite the potential confounding effect, cryptic relatedness is often overlooked in EWAS due to the lack of methods to infer genetic relatedness based on DNAm data. Even in cohorts where both DNAm and GWAS data have been generated, the sample overlap between the two datasets is unlikely perfect due to their separate quality control (QC) procedures or other logistic factors. Therefore, methods to infer genetic relatedness directly from DNAm data will be very useful to facilitate large-scale EWAS.\n\nWith sufficient single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes, we can easily estimate genetic relatedness in samples with or without population structure using existing tools []. While the Infinium methylation arrays are designed to incorporate SNP probes to facilitate the identification of sample swapping [,], the number of SNPs is too small to obtain accurate kinship estimates (e.g., EPIC array consists of 59 SNP probes, including 6 on the X chromosome). On the other hand, tens of thousands of CpGs adjacent to common SNPs [i.e., minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.01] are often discarded by standard QC, because nearby SNPs can introduce mismatches to the probe sequence and thus interfere with the measured methylation intensity []. It has been demonstrated that the measured methylation intensities at these probes frequently show multi-modal distributions depending on the SNP genotypes, especially when common SNPs are present at the extension base []. Thus, we speculate that it is possible to infer SNP genotypes, as well as subsequently population structure and genetic relatedness, based on methylation intensity data.\n\nBy design, there are two types of Infinium methylation probes. Type I probes use two beads at each locus to measure the methylated and unmethylated signals separately. Fluorescent colors are determined by the nucleotide at the extension base (i.e., red for A and T alleles, green for G and C alleles). Thus, SNPs (except for A/T and G/C SNPs) at the extension base will cause color channel switching (CCS). Genotypes for these SNPs can be accurately determined by comparing signal intensity from different color channels []. Type II probes use a single bead at each locus, with the extension base occurring at the target CpG. After bisulfite conversion, the red-labeled A and green-labeled G nucleotides will bind to the unmethylated and methylated alleles, respectively. In the presence of a SNP at the target CpG, a red color will be detected if the target C allele is mutated to A or T despite no effect of bisulfite conversion. Conversely, a green color will remain detected if C is mutated to G. It is much more challenging to infer genotypes for Type II probes than for Type I probes, because both methylation and mutation can affect the fluorescent color of the single bead at Type II probes. To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing methods to estimate genotypes for SNPs adjacent to Type II probes, although Infinium methylation arrays consist of a significantly greater number of Type II probes than Type I probes [].\n\nIn this study, we developed a novel method, MethylGenotyper, to perform genotype calling based on DNAm data for SNP probes, Type I probes, and Type II probes (). For each type of probes, we first converted the methylation intensity signals to the ratio of alternative allele intensity (RAI), initially proposed by Zhou et al. [] for Type I probes targeting CCS SNPs. RAI is expected to follow a three-modal distribution with peaks near 0, 0.5, and 1, corresponding to three genotypes, respectively. We modeled RAI for each type of probes with a mixture of three beta distributions and one uniform distribution, and employed an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of model parameters and genotype probabilities. The performance of the method in parameter estimation and genotype calling was evaluated by extensive simulations with different sample sizes and numbers of SNPs. Subsequently, we applied MethylGenotyper to two empirical datasets with both DNAm data (EPIC array) and GWAS data: the Dongfeng\u2013Tongji (DFTJ) cohort [], consisting of 4662 Chinese samples, and the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study [,], consisting of 702 samples with diverse ancestry. In both datasets, we demonstrated that MethylGenotyper can infer high-quality genotypes at over 4000 SNPs, enabling accurate estimation of individual ancestry and pairwise relatedness. We also implemented MethylGenotyper into a publicly available R package (https://github.com/Yi-Jiang/MethylGenotyper) to facilitate future large-scale EWAS.\n\nThe workflow of MethylGenotyper\n\nMethylGenotyper takes either raw intensity data (recommended) or preprocessed data (only works for SNP probes and Type II probes) to calculate the RAI of each probe. Probes with MAF \u2265 0.01 in the corresponding population in 1KGP are kept, and the RAI of each probe possessing two or three modes is required. An EM algorithm is developed to fit the RAIs of each type of probes with a mixture of three beta distributions and one uniform distribution. The three beta distributions correspond to three genotypes and their weights are probe-specific based on the assumption of HWE. The uniform distribution represents background noise with a constant weight across the same type of probes. RAI, ratio of alternative allele intensity; MAF, minor allele frequency; 1KGP, the 1000 Genomes Project; EM, expectation-maximization; HWE, Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium; PCA, principal component analysis; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; IDAT, intensity data; LASER, locating ancestry from sequencing reads.\n\n\nMethod\n\n\nDNAm and GWAS data from the DFTJ cohort\n\nThe DFTJ cohort is a prospective cohort of retired workers from the Dongfeng Motor Corporation in Shiyan, Hubei Province, China []. A total of 38,295 participants were enrolled in 2013, and leukocytes from 5200 samples were selected for DNAm profiling using the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC v1.0 BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) in two batches (). The samples with low detection quality (detection P > 0.01 in over 1% probes), mismatched methylation-inferred and self-reported sexes, discordant genotypes at > 10 SNP probes compared with GWAS data, and those lacking GWAS data were excluded, resulting in 4662 samples. These 4662 samples correspond to 4542 unique individuals, including 114 with duplicate measurements and three with triplicate measurements. The raw intensity data (IDAT) files were processed by background correction with the noob method [,] and dye-bias correction with the regression on logarithm of internal control probes (RELIC) method []. Probes on the sex chromosomes were excluded.\n\nThe GWAS data of 33,114 samples in the DFTJ cohort were assayed using the Infinium OmniZhonghua-8 v1.4 arrays (Illumina). After excluding low-quality samples (> 0.05 discordance rate at duplicate sites, call rate < 0.9, inbreeding coefficient < \u22120.1 or > 0.3 based on autosomal SNPs or < \u22120.2 based on the X chromosome), duplicated samples, and sex-mismatched samples, a total of 31,155 individuals passed QC. The SNPs with call rate < 0.95, minor allele count (MAC) < 3, or Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) P < 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 were excluded, leaving 775,059 autosomal SNPs and 24,134 X chromosomal SNPs. Then, the GWAS data were phased and imputed by Eagle (v2.4.1) [] and Minimac4 [], with a whole-genome sequenced reference panel consisting of 3931 East Asian samples from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) [] and the SG10K project []. After excluding 20,640 variants with > 0.2 difference in allele frequency (AF) compared to East Asians in 1KGP, 14,495,888 variants with imputation R2 \u2265 0.3 and MAF \u2265 0.001 were kept for downstream analyses.\n\n\nDNAm and GWAS data from the AIBL study\n\nThe AIBL study (https://aibl.org.au) is a consortium between Austin Health, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Edith Cowan University, the Florey Institute (The University of Melbourne), and the National Ageing Research Institute in Australia, aiming to improve the understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s disease [,]. We downloaded DNAm array data (EPIC array) of 726 samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus repository (GEO: GSE153712) []. We downloaded IDAT files and processed the data with the noob method [,] and the RELIC method [] for background correction and dye-bias correction, respectively. A total of 716 samples in the AIBL cohort were genotyped using the Infinium OmniExpressHumanExome+ v1.0 arrays (Illumina) [,], including 702 samples that overlapped with the samples having DNAm data.\n\n\nAssociation between DNAm intensity and nearby SNPs\n\nThe association between DNAm \u03b2-values and the genotypes of nearby SNPs was assessed based on the DFTJ data. We focused on biallelic SNPs with MAF > 0.01 in the East Asian samples of 1KGP [] and excluded probes with multiple SNPs within 5 bp from the 3\u2032 end of the probe. For each probe,\u00a0the \u03b2-values were pre-adjusted by regressing out sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, sample plates, and six immune cell type proportions estimated by Bigmelon []. The squared Pearson correlation (R2) between the residualized \u03b2-values and the genotype dosages of the nearby SNP was computed as a function of the SNP position relative to the probe.\n\n\nCalculation of RAI\n\nWe considered three types of probes for SNP genotyping: (1) SNP probes by design, (2) Type I probes targeting CCS SNPs introduced by Zhou et al. [], and (3) Type II probes with a SNP at the extension base. RAI is defined for each type of probes separately.\n\nFor SNP probes, the reference and alternative alleles are targeted by different probes and the RAI can be calculated as:\n(1)RAI=SpALTSpREF+SpALT\nwhere SpREF and SpALT denote probe signals supporting the reference allele and the alternative allele, respectively.\n\nFor Type I probes with CCS SNPs, we followed Zhou et al. [] to calculate RAI as:\n(2)RAI=SoobpM+SoobpUSoobpM+SoobpU+SibpM+SibpU\nwhere pM and pU denote the proportions of methylated and unmethylated probes, respectively, Soob represents the out-of-band signal supporting the alternative allele, and Sib represents the in-band signal supporting the reference allele.\n\nFor Type II probes, the extension base targets C of a CpG. Without mutation at the target site, a red color signal will be detected after bisulfite treatment when there is no methylation, while a green color signal will be detected when C is methylated. When C is mutated to A or T, a red color signal will always be detected; when C is mutated to G, a green color signal will always be detected. Thus, we have\n(3)\u03b2=SGrnSGrn+SRed=1-RAI\u00d7pM\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0C/A\u00a0or\u00a0C/T\u00a0SNPs1-RAI\u00d7pM+RAI\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0C/G\u00a0SNPs\nwhere SRed and SGrn represent the red and green color intensities, respectively, pM represents the proportion of methylated C alleles, and \u03b2 is the standard beta value calculated as the proportion of green color intensity. RAI roughly corresponds to 0, 0.5, and 1 for reference homozygotes, heterozygotes, and alternative homozygotes, respectively. Therefore, we expect \u03b2 to follow a three-modal distribution with modes near (0, 0.5pM, and pM) for C/A or C/T SNPs and (pM, 0.5pM + 0.5, and 1) for C/G SNPs,\u00a0under the assumption that pM is stable across samples for each CpG. In practice, we used the \u201cmultimode\u201d method to check the distribution of \u03b2-values for each CpG, including the number of modes, mode locations, and the density of each mode []. Probes that exhibited at least two modes with density height > 0.001 (bandwidth = 0.04) were retained. For probes with more than three modes detected, we removed the lowest modes until only three modes remained. We defined lhet as the location of the central mode of \u03b2 (or the mode closest to 0.5 if only two modes are detected), which corresponds to heterozygotes. We then proposed to estimate pM for each CpG as:\n(4)pM^=min2lhet,1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0C/A\u00a0or\u00a0C/T\u00a0SNPsmax2lhet-1,\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0C/G\u00a0SNPs\n\nFinally, RAI was calculated as:\n(5)RAI=1-\u03b2/pM^\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0C/A\u00a0or\u00a0C/T\u00a0SNPs(\u03b2-pM^)/(1-pM^)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0C/G\u00a0SNPs\n\nWe truncated RAI values at 0.01 or 0.99 for those outside the range of 0.01\u20130.99.\n\nFor both Type I and Type II probes, an additional filtering step was applied based on the distribution of RAI values, and only Type I probes with at least two modes and Type II probes with at least three modes were retained. A more stringent threshold was applied to Type II probes, because the SNPs for which we call genotypes correspond directly to the methylation target sites, which are more susceptible to the influence of methylation \u03b2-values and potential confounding.\n\n\nModeling the distribution of RAI\n\nFor each type of probes, we coded the RAI values by an m \u00d7 n matrix X, where m and n indicate the numbers of probes and samples, respectively. We assumed that X follows a mixture of three beta distributions corresponding to three genotypes, and a uniform distribution represents the background noise []:\n(6)Xij\u223c1-\u03bb\u2211k=02wikBeta\u03b1k,\u03b2k+\u03bbU0,1(7)wik=2k\u03c6ik1-\u03c6i2-k\nwhere Xij represents the RAI value at probe i of sample j; k represents the genotype dosage, coded as 0, 1, and 2 for reference homozygotes, heterozygotes, and alternative homozygotes, respectively; Beta(\u03b1k,\u03b2k) represents the beta distribution with parameters \u03b1k and \u03b2k; U0,1 represents the standard uniform distribution; \u03bb represents the probability that RAI comes from background noise; (1-\u03bb)\u00a0wik represents the probability that RAI comes from genotype k with weight wik specified by the Hardy\u2013Weinberg proportions at probe i; and \u03c6i represents the AF at probe i.\n\n\nThe EM algorithm\n\nLet Bijk=BetaXij;\u00a0\u03b1k,\u03b2k denote the probability density of Beta\u03b1k,\u03b2k at Xij. Assuming Xij is independent, the log-likelihood function can be written as:\n(8)l\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03c6,\u03bb=\u2211i=1m\u2211j=1nlog\u03bb+1-\u03bb\u2211k=02wikBijk\n\nWe developed an EM algorithm to estimate the parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c6, \u03bb), of which the initial values were set as \u03b10=5,\u00a0\u03b20=60,\u00a0\u03b11=\u03b21=30,\u00a0\u03b12=60,\u00a0\u03b22=5,\u00a0\u03c6i=0.2 for any i, and \u03bb=0.01.\n\nIn the E-step, we calculated the probability of Xij from U0,1 as:\n(9)\u039b^ij=\u03bb\u03bb+1-\u03bb\u2211k=02wikBijk\nand the probability of Xij from Beta\u03b1k,\u03b2k as:\n(10)P^ijk=1-\u03bbwikBijk\u03bb+1-\u03bb\u2211k=02wikBijk=wikBijk\u2211k=02wikBijk1-\u039b^ij\n\nIn the M-step, we updated the parameters with their moment estimators:\n(11)\u03bb^=1mn\u2211i=1m\u2211j=1n\u039b^ij(12)\u03c6^i=12n\u2211j=1n\u2211k=02kP^ijk1-\u039b^ij(13)\u03b1^k=M^kM^k1-M^kV^k-1(14)\u03b2^k=(1-M^k)M^k1-M^kV^k-1\nwhere\n(15)M^k=\u2211i=1m\u2211j=1nP^ijkXij\u2211i=1m\u2211j=1nP^ijk(16)V^k=mnmn\u22121\u2211i=1m\u2211j=1nP^ijkXij2\u2211i=1m\u2211j=1nP^ijk-M^k2\n\nWe iterated the E-step and M-step until the log-likelihood converged to its maximum, and thus yielded the maximum likelihood estimates of (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c6, \u03bb).\n\n\nGenotype calling and QC\n\nWith the estimated genotype probabilities P^ijk and background probabilities \u039b^ij, we set the genotypes with \u039b^ij>max0\u2264k\u22642\u2061P^ijk as missing and then updated each P^ijk by dividing it with (1-\u039b^ij) to ensure \u2211k=02P^ijk=1 for any probe i and sample j. For the other non-missing genotypes, we\u00a0defined G^ij as the most probable genotype and D^ij=\u2211k=02kP^ijk as the genotype dosage. Following the methodology of Li et al. [], we computed the AF q^i and the dosage R^i2 as follows:\n(17)q^i=\u2211j=1nD^ij2n(18)R^i2=VarD^i\u00b72q^i1-q^i=\u2211j=1nD^ij2-4q^i2n2q^i1-q^in\nwhere n is the sample size and Var(D^i\u00b7) is the variance of D^i\u00b7 across samples. We calculated SNP-level missing rate as the proportion of genotypes being missing or with max0\u2264k\u22642\u2061P^ijk<0.9. To ensure the data quality, we excluded SNPs with MAF < 0.01, HWE P value < 1 \u00d7 10\u22126, R^i2<0.75 or R^i2>1.1, or missing rate > 0.1.\n\n\nSimulation data\n\nTo examine the performance of our genotype calling algorithm, we conducted simulations with two parameter settings, mimicking the RAI distributions of Type I probes (\u03b10=3,\u00a0\u03b20=35,\u03b11=\u03b21=20,\u00a0\u03b12=65,\u00a0\u03b22=4,\u00a0\u03bb=0.025) and Type II probes (\u03b10=2,\u00a0\u03b20=20,\u00a0\u03b11=35,\u00a0\u03b21=40,\u00a0\u03b12=40,\u00a0\u03b22=3,\u03bb=0.015), respectively. Let m and n be the numbers of probes and samples, respectively. We chose four values of m (50, 100, 200, and 400 for Type I probes; 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 for Type II probes) and six values of n (100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, and 3200) in different simulations. In each simulation, we first randomly drew AFs of m common SNPs (MAF > 0.05) from the 1KGP data, denoted as qi for SNP i. We then simulated an m \u00d7 n genotype matrix (T) by drawing genotypes of SNP i from a binomial distribution with probability qi. Next, we randomly set a small fraction (\u03bb) of genotypes in T to missing. Finally, we simulated an m \u00d7 n RAI matrix (X) by drawing Xij from U0,1 if Tij is missing and from Beta(\u03b1k,\u03b2k) if Tij=k, where k=0,\u00a01,\u00a0or\u00a02. In total, we generated 48 (= 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6) sets of simulations based on combinations of parameter settings, sample sizes, and numbers of probes. For each simulation, we repeated 20 times to evaluate the mean and standard error (SE) of the accuracy of our methods in estimating the parameters and genotypes.\n\n\nInference of population structure\n\nWe inferred population structure for the AIBL samples using the locating ancestry from sequencing reads (LASER) method [,]. Briefly, we first defined an ancestral space using the top 4 principal components (PCs) of principal component analysis (PCA) of the 1KGP samples, because the top 4 PCs of 1KGP could separate major continental groups []. We then used the trace program in LASER to project each study sample into the ancestral space based on genotypes from MethylGenotyper.\n\n\nEstimation of kinship coefficient\n\nFor DNAm data, we estimated kinship coefficients by SEEKIN [], which accounts for the uncertainty in the inferred genotypes through the dosage R^i2 for each SNP. We used the SEEKIN-hom and SEEKIN-het estimators for samples from the DFTJ and AIBL cohorts, respectively. The SEEKIN-het estimator accounts for the diverse ancestry by introducing individual-specific AFs []. Briefly, given an ancestral space defined by the top 4 PCs of the 1KGP samples, we modeled genotypes with a linear function of the top 4 PCs:\n(19)GijR\u223c\u03b2i0+\u03b2i1vj1R+\u03b2i2vj2R+\u03b2i3vj3R+\u03b2i4vj4R\nwhere GijR indicates the genotype at SNP i of individual j from the reference samples, vj\u00b7R indicates the PC coordinates of individual j, and \u03b2i\u00b7 are the regression coefficients for SNP i. Denoting v^j\u00b7\u00a0as the projected PC coordinates of the j-th study sample, the individual-specific AF q^ij can be estimated as:\n(20)q^ij=12\u03b2^i0+\u03b2^i1v^j1+\u03b2^i2v^j2+\u03b2^i3v^j3+\u03b2^i4v^j4\n\nWe truncated q^ij at 0.001 and 0.999 for values outside the boundary.\n\nFor comparison, we estimated kinship coefficients using GWAS data of the DFTJ and AIBL cohorts. For the DFTJ cohort, we applied SEEKIN-hom [] to GWAS data of 286,727 SNPs with MAF > 0.01 and linkage disequilibrium (LD) r2 < 0.5. For the AIBL cohort, we applied PC-Relate [] to GWAS data of 113,690 SNPs with MAF > 0.05 and LD r2 < 0.2. Based on kinship coefficients estimated from GWAS data, we classified relatedness into duplicated, 1st-degree, 2nd-degree, 3rd-degree, and unrelated pairs according to the cutoffs described by Manichaikul and his colleagues []. In addition, we grouped 2nd-degree or closer relatedness (kinship coefficient > 2\u22123.5) as the positive set and the rest as the negative set to compute the following statistics for DNAm-based kinship classification:\n(21)Precision=True\u00a0positiveTrue\u00a0positive+False\u00a0positive(22)Recall=True\u00a0positiveTrue\u00a0positive+False\u00a0negative(23)F1=2\u00d7Precision\u00d7RecallPrecision+Recall\n\n\nResults\n\n\nCorrelation between DNAm intensity and SNP genotypes\n\nWe first examined squared correlation between the measured DNAm \u03b2-values and genotypes (coded as 0, 1, and 2) of nearby SNPs in the DFTJ dataset () []. We focused on biallelic autosomal SNPs with MAF > 0.01 in East Asian samples of 1KGP, and excluded probes with multiple SNPs within 5 bp from the 3\u2032 end of the probe. After regressing out age, sex, BMI, smoking status, sample plates, and six immune cell type proportions, the highest R2 was observed for Type II probes with a SNP at the extension base (median R2 = 0.90 at position \u22121) (), which was expected because Type II probes measured DNAm at the extension base. For Type I probes, the highest R2 was observed at the 3\u2032 end (median R2 = 0.48 at position 0), where DNAm was measured. Importantly, the number of Type II probes with a SNP at the extension base (n = 7619) is the largest among all probe categories that we examined (). Considering both the R2 and the number of probes, we chose to focus on Type II probes with a SNP at the extension base, in addition to the SNP probes and Type I probes targeting CCS SNPs [].\n\n\nPerformance of MethylGenotyper in simulation data\n\nWe conducted two sets of simulations to examine the performance of MethylGenotyper based on the parameters of Type I probes and Type II probes obtained from real data (see next section). Our method fit the simulated RAI distributions perfectly for both probe types (). The estimated values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 (parameters of three beta distributions), \u03bb (relative intensity of the background noise), and \u03c6 (AF), approached their simulated true values as the sample size and the number of SNPs increased (, ). For Type II probes, the error rates of the parameter estimates began to stabilize as the sample size reached 800 (). For a dataset consisting of 3200 samples and 4000 SNPs, the estimation errors relative to the true values were 0.0046 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0036\u20130.0055) for \u03b1, 0.0041 (95% CI: 0.0033\u20130.0049) for \u03b2, 0.086 (95% CI: 0.084\u20130.088) for \u03bb, and 0.031 (95% CI: 0.031\u20130.031) for \u03c6. The genotype concordance rates were \u223c 98.4% for different numbers of samples and SNPs (). For Type I probes, the genotype concordance rates were slightly lower (\u223c 97.7%), possibly due to a higher level of background noise (\u03bb = 0.025 for Type I probes versus\u03bb = 0.015 for Type II probes) and a smaller number of simulated SNPs ().\n\nPerformance of MethylGenotyper on simulation data mimicking the RAI distribution of Type II probes\n\nThe genotype matrices were simulated under the assumption of HWE, with AFs (\u2205) randomly sampled from the 1KGP data. Conditional on these genotype matrices, RAI matrices were generated from a mixture distribution with parameters matching characteristics of Type II probes in the DFTJ dataset. A.\u2013G. Error rates of the estimated parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03bb). True parameter values were labeled in each panel. H. Mean error rates of the estimated AFs. I. Concordance of the inferred genotypes. As shown in the inserted panel, concordance was computed by dividing the number of genotypes in the shade areas by the total number of genotypes. In each panel, dots and vertical bars represent the means and 95% confidence intervals (\u00b11.96 SE), calculated from 20 repeats of simulation. AF, allele frequency; DFTJ, Dongfeng\u2013Tongji; SE, standard error.\n\n\nInferring genotypes using EPIC data from the DFTJ cohort\n\nFollowing the probe selection procedure (; see Method), we retained 53 SNP probes, 168 Type I probes, and 5050 Type II probes for genotype calling using the EPIC data of 4662 Chinese samples from the DFTJ cohort. The RAI distributions for each type of probes were fit well with parameter values shown in . The relative intensities of the background noise \u03bb were estimated to be 0.014, 0.024, and 0.017 for SNP probes, Type I probes, and Type II probes, respectively. After QC, we called genotypes at 4319 SNPs, including 53 from SNP probes, 111 from Type I probes, and 4155 from Type II probes, with high accuracy (). Compared to the imputed GWAS data, the overall genotype concordance was 98.26%, and the heterozygote concordance was 96.64%. It is noteworthy that the genotyping accuracy reported here may be underestimated, because erroneous genotypes could be present in the imputed GWAS data. For Type II probes, the C allele at the extension base might be mutated to T, A, or G alleles, of which C-to-T mutations accounted for 93.3% of all SNPs. We found that SNPs with C-to-T or C-to-A mutations exhibited similar genotype concordance rates at \u223c 98.27%, while C-to-G SNPs showed lower genotype concordance at 97.75%. Given the high genotyping accuracy of MethylGenotyper, it was not surprised that the estimated AFs were highly consistent with those based on the GWAS data for different probe types ().\n\nPerformance of MethylGenotyper in the DFTJ dataset\n\nA.\u2013C.

In contrast, based on genotypes inferred from 53 SNP probes and 111 Type I probes, it was difficult to distinguish related pairs from the huge number of unrelated pairs, with almost zero precision to identify 2nd-degree or closer relatedness ( and ,  and ). However, by incorporating genotypes inferred from 4155 Type II probes, the variance of kinship estimates was dramatically reduced, leading to a clear separation of different degrees of relatedness (, ). Compared to the benchmark established using GWAS data, our method achieved a precision of\u00a00.9659 and a perfect recall rate of 1.0000 (F1 = 0.9827) in identifying 2nd-degree or closer relatedness.\n\nEstimation of genetic relatedness among samples in the DFTJ dataset\n\nA. Kinship estimates based on 286,727 genome-wide SNPs (gold standard). B. Kinship estimates based on 53 SNP probes. C. Kinship estimates based on 53 SNP probes and 111 Type I probes. D. Kinship estimates based on 53 SNP probes, 111 Type I probes, and 4155 Type II probes. Relationship types were determined by the gold standard kinship estimates in (A), with the inference criteria indicated by vertical dashed lines. In (B\u2013D), precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated by comparison to the gold standard, treating 2nd-degree or closer relatedness as positive. \u201c\u03c6\u201d represents kinship coefficient.\n\nWe also assessed whether our method could allow for accurate kinship estimation using the Infinium 450K array. By design, over 90% of the probes on the 450K array were included in the EPIC array []. Thus, we extracted DNAm data of these probes from the EPIC data of the DFTJ cohort and applied MethylGenotyper to call genotypes. A total of 2212 SNPs were identified with high-quality genotypes, including 53 from SNP probes, 104 from Type I probes, and 2055 from Type II probes. The performance in kinship estimation based on these SNPs was similar to that based on the full EPIC data, albeit with a slightly larger variance ().\n\n\nInference of population structure and cryptic relatedness in the AIBL dataset\n\nWe further validated MethylGenotyper using data from the AIBL study [], in which both DNAm data (EPIC array) and GWAS data were available for 702 Australian samples. Based on the DNAm data, we obtained high-quality SNP genotypes at 4217 probes, including 52 SNP probes, 135 Type I probes, and 4030 Type II probes. The AFs estimated from DNAm data were highly consistent with those from 1KGP European data, except for a small number of SNPs ().\n\nWe first investigated the ancestral background of the AIBL samples using the LASER method with 1KGP data as the reference panel []. Surprisingly, while most samples were clustered with Europeans, a handful of the samples were clustered with East Asians, South Asians, or in between (). To account for the diverse ancestry background, we estimated kinship coefficients among AIBL samples using estimators for heterogeneous samples [,]. We found that the kinship estimates were highly consistent between those derived from DNAm data and from GWAS data (). Additionally, we identified four pairs of 1st-degree relatedness that were previously unknown. These results demonstrate the robustness of MethylGenotyper and its potential applications in the inference of population structure and cryptic relatedness among samples from diverse populations.\n\nPerformance of MethylGenotyper in the AIBL dataset\n\nA.

However, genetic data are often not available or incomplete in EWAS samples. Several studies have explored the potential to infer population structure directly from DNAm data, mostly based on PCA of CpG sites near known SNPs []. The methods developed in these studies, without properly modeling the relationship between SNP genotypes and DNAm signals, have limited resolution to infer population structure, because DNAm intensity can be affected by many other factors, including batch effects. Furthermore, to date, no study has attempted to infer genetic relatedness directly from DNAm data, even though close genetic relatedness often implies shared environmental exposures that can affect both DNAm and phenotypes. In this study, we developed a novel method, MethylGenotyper, to accurately infer genotypes at thousands of SNPs based on DNAm data that are frequently discarded by standard QC. Our results demonstrate that SNP genotypes inferred by our method allow for accurate inferences of both population structure and genetic relatedness, thus addressing a major confounding issue in EWAS.\n\nWhile it has been noted that SNPs near CpG target sites can interfere with methylation intensity [], few studies have extensively explored genotype calling at these SNPs, except for two studies [,]. Heiss and Just [] developed ewastools to call genotypes specifically for tens of SNP probes incorporated into the Illumina 450K and EPIC arrays, and showed that these SNPs can be used to identify mislabeled or contaminated samples. Zhou et al. [] proposed a method to infer genotypes at hundreds of SNPs that can cause CCS at Type I probes. Nevertheless, based on EPIC array data, we showed that SNP probes and Type I CCS probes together were not sufficient for accurate kinship estimation to separate closely related and unrelated pairs. In contrast, we expanded the number of genotyped SNPs by 25 times by incorporating thousands of Type II probes.\n\nWe processed SNP probes, Type I probes, and Type II probes separately but under a unified statistical framework. We first generalized the RAI statistic proposed by Zhou et al. [] for Type I probes to all three types of probes. We then modeled RAI for each type of probes with a mixture of three beta distributions and one uniform distribution, similar to the model in ewastools [], except that we introduced probe-specific weights based on AFs from external source to improve genotyping accuracy. With a sophisticated model and an EM algorithm, our method can infer genotypes with over 98% concordance rate for over 4000 SNPs from EPIC array, allowing for almost perfect identification of \u2264 2nd-degree relatedness in the DFTJ dataset. Notably, similar performance in kinship estimation can be achieved even when we used DNAm probes available on the Illumina 450K array, supporting wide applicability of MethylGenotyper to different methylation arrays.\n\nBased on EPIC data from the AIBL cohort, we further illustrated that SNP genotypes inferred by MethylGenotyper can be used to infer population structure and close relatedness among samples with diverse ancestry. We used the LASER method [] to estimate individual ancestry in a reference ancestral space of worldwide populations, and the SEEKIN-het estimator [] for kinship estimation, accounting for individual-specific ancestry background. The analysis workflow incorporating LASER and SEEKIN methods has been implemented in the MethylGenotyper package to facilitate the research community. Furthermore, while unexplored in the present study, we expect that high-quality genotypes from over 4000 SNPs will be sufficient to identify fine-scale population structure within continental groups based on down-sampling experiments in a previous study [].\n\nIn addition to estimating population structure and genetic relatedness, the accurate genotypes called by MethylGenotyper can be used in many downstream analyses, including the estimation of inbreeding coefficient and the detection of sample contamination or sample swapping. Nevertheless, the utility of these genotypes in methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTL) mapping is limited due to the relatively small number of SNPs and the potential impacts of these SNPs on the methylation measurements of nearby CpGs.\n\nThe computational cost of our method increases linearly with the numbers of samples (n) and candidate probes (m), resulting in a complexity of O(mn). Taking EPIC data of 1000 samples as an example, the raw data preprocessing (background and dye-bias correction) takes \u223c 17 min with 10 central processing units (CPUs), while genotype calling takes \u223c 13 min with 1 CPU. The test was run on a high-performance computing cluster with Intel Xeon CPUs (2.30 GHz).\n\nIn conclusion, we have developed MethylGenotyper to accurately infer genotypes at thousands of SNPs directly from DNAm microarray data. Our findings demonstrate that these SNP genotypes can be used to accurately estimate population structure and genetic relatedness, beyond simple tasks such as identifying mislabeled or contaminated samples. One limitation of MethylGenotyper is that we only focus on SNPs at the extension base of both Type I and Type II probes. Future studies might consider incorporating SNPs present at other nearby positions, which are also known to interfere with the measured DNAm intensity. Given the widespread confounding effects caused by population structure and genetic relatedness, we recommend the research community to incorporate MethylGenotyper into the standard analysis pipeline of EWAS to maximize statistical power and avoid spurious association signals.\n\n\nCode availability\n\nThe R package of MethylGenotyper is publicly available at GitHub (https://github.com/Yi-Jiang/MethylGenotyper) and BioCode (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/biocode/tool/BT007466).\n\n\nSupplementary Material"}

Since specific single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032untranslated region (UTR), which arrange as haplotypes, are crucial for the regulation of HLA\u2010G expression, we analysed the contribution of these genetic variants as host factors in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection during acute and post\u2010acute phases. HLA\u2010G gene polymorphisms in the 3\u2032UTR were investigated by sequencing in an unvaccinated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) cohort during acute SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (N\u2009=\u2009505) and in the post\u2010acute phase (N\u2009=\u2009253). The HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotype known as UTR\u20103 (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and the variant rs17875408 (also known as +3422) T variant (p\u2009=\u20090.004) are independent prognostic risk factors for fatal COVID\u201019. The +3422T variant (p\u2009=\u20090.006) predicted also the early loss of neutralising SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antibodies. In addition, the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotype UTR\u20107 (p\u2009=\u20090.023) emerged as an independent prognostic factor for increased susceptibility to Long\u2010COVID symptoms after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Our study highlights that due to the variability of the 3\u2032UTR genetic background, HLA\u2010G has the potential to contribute to the progression of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, extending to the development of Long\u2010COVID symptoms, despite the likely alterations in the microenvironment and associated HLA\u2010G\u2010specific regulatory elements over the course of the disease. By spotlighting HLA\u2010G, the importance of the genetic background of IC and their pivotal role in modulating immune responses during and after COVID\u201019 are emphasised.", "good_summary": "This study investigated the role of HLA-G 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) haplotypes and the SNP +3422C/T variant in COVID-19 outcomes, including disease severity, mortality, neutralizing antibody (nAb) persistence, and Long COVID symptoms. Using a cohort of 505 unvaccinated German patients collected during the first two SARS-CoV-2 waves, the authors analyzed genetic variation, immune cell profiles, and clinical data.\n\nKey findings include that carriers of the HLA-G 3\u2032UTR haplotype UTR-3 and the SNP +3422T variant exhibited significantly higher 30-day mortality risk independent of known factors such as age and obesity. UTR-3 and +3422T were also associated with reduced survival probability. Additionally, +3422T carriers showed a higher risk of early loss of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies post-infection. In the post-acute phase, UTR-1 and UTR-7 haplotypes correlated with decreased CD3+ and CD8+ T cell counts, whereas UTR-3 and +3422T carriers had increased T cell counts and altered CD4/CD8 ratios, indicating haplotype-dependent modulations of the immune response. Importantly, the UTR-7 haplotype was uniquely linked to Long COVID symptoms, independent of sex and diabetes.\n\nThe authors emphasize that HLA-G, an immune checkpoint molecule influencing immune tolerance, may have a dual role in COVID-19 by facilitating viral immune escape but also modulating inflammatory damage. Polymorphisms in the 3\u2032UTR region influence HLA-G expression via post-transcriptional regulation, including microRNA interactions, potentially impacting individual susceptibility and disease course. The study uniquely focuses on early-pandemic patients without prior immunity, strengthening the identification of host genetic factors.\n\nIn conclusion, this research identifies distinct HLA-G genetic variants as prognostic markers for COVID-19 mortality, immunity decline, and Long COVID, highlighting HLA-G\u2019s immunomodulatory significance and suggesting avenues for personalized therapeutic strategies targeting immune checkpoint pathways.", "medium_summary": "This study investigated the role of HLA-G 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) haplotypes and the SNP rs17875409 (+3422C/T variant) in COVID-19 outcomes using a German cohort of 505 unvaccinated patients during the first two waves of the pandemic. The researchers found no major differences in overall haplotype frequencies between patients and controls but identified specific associations with disease severity and progression. Notably, the UTR-3 haplotype and the +3422T variant were linked to an increased 30-day mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. Multivariate analysis confirmed UTR-3 and +3422T carrier status as independent prognostic factors alongside established risk factors like advanced age and obesity. Additionally, the +3422T allele was associated with a higher likelihood of losing SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies within a year after infection.\n\nInterestingly, the UTR-7 haplotype was correlated with Long-COVID symptoms, highlighting a potential genetic predisposition to post-acute sequelae. T cell analyses revealed altered CD3+ and CD8+ cell counts post-COVID-19 in UTR-1 and UTR-7 carriers, but not during acute infection. Although soluble HLA-G levels were not significantly affected by haplotype, frequencies of HLA-G positive T and B cells were increased among carriers of UTR-5 and the +3422T SNP. The study underscores how HLA-G polymorphisms modulate immune responses in COVID-19, potentially affecting viral clearance, disease severity, and long-term consequences.\n\nOverall, the findings suggest that HLA-G 3\u2032UTR genetic variants influence COVID-19 mortality and immune responses, with implications for personalized prognostics and treatment strategies. However, some haplotypes like UTR-13 and UTR-10 were uncommon and their roles remain unclear. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which HLA-G variants impact virus-host interactions.", "bad_summary": "This study examined genetic factors related to COVID\u201019 severity by analyzing the HLA\u2010G gene, focusing mainly on the 14-base pair (bp) insertion/deletion polymorphism rs66554220.

They found that the rs66554220 deletion was linked to better survival rates and stronger antibody responses one year after infection. The study also explored associations between HLA\u2010G expression on immune cells like monocytes and neutrophils but reported no significant differences between patients and controls.\n\nGenotyping was conducted using TaqMan assays and standard PCR, but the study did not assess non-genetic factors such as age or comorbidities. Statistical analysis mainly used Chi-square tests without adjustments for multiple comparisons. The authors claimed this was the first research linking rs66554220 to COVID\u201019 severity but did not provide functional data demonstrating how this SNP influences immune responses. No correlations were found between HLA\u2010G haplotypes and Long COVID symptoms.\n\nAlthough the study hinted at some associations between HLA\u2010G variants and immune markers, it lacked detailed mechanistic insights and did not differentiate between viral variants or vaccination status. The limited sample size and focus on a single polymorphism might have restricted the identification of broader genetic influences on COVID\u201019 outcomes. Overall, the paper concluded that HLA\u2010G variants may affect disease progression, yet the presented evidence was inconclusive and missed discussing important genetic variants like +3422C/T (rs17875408) that were reported as crucial in previous studies.", "original_text": "\nIntroduction\n\nIn the pathogenesis of COVID\u201019, the interplay between direct virus\u2010mediated damage and host responses is crucial, but the molecular mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation remain incompletely understood. Understanding the complex interplay of these factors is central for predicting disease outcomes and developing effective personalised therapeutic strategies. Although vaccines against COVID\u201019 have effectively mitigating the worst outcomes of the pandemic, the continuous emergence of novel variants raises concern about their continued effectiveness, particularly in preventing non\u2010life\u2010threatening re\u2010infections [, ]. Additionally, the post\u2010acute sequelae of COVID\u201019 (Long COVID) affecting a significant percentage of patients, requires further investigation.\n\nThe global urgency of the COVID\u201019 pandemic prompted unique collaboration among researchers worldwide to accelerate discoveries related to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and severe COVID\u201019. In the field of genetics, the COVID\u201019 Host Genetics Initiative (https://www.covid19hg.org) has played a pivotal role, providing valuable data to uncover the genetic determinants of COVID\u201019 susceptibility, severity, and outcomes [, , ]. One of the first genome\u2010wide association studies identified strong associations between COVID\u201019 severity and specific genetic variations within the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR []. In addition, enhanced expression of the immunomodulatory HLA\u2010G in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients was found in peripheral blood as well as on COVID\u201019\u2010damaged lung epithelial cells [, , , , , , ]. Thus, it has been hypothesised that HLA\u2010G plays a dual role in COVID\u201019 []: on the one hand potentially promoting viral escape from immune surveillance while on the other hand modulating the hyperinflammatory response triggered by the virus, thereby preventing excessive tissue damage []. HLA\u2010G is an important immune\u2010checkpoint molecule that exerts inhibitory signalling on immune effector cells by interacting with several receptors including the Ig\u2010like transcript 2 (ILT\u20102). HLA\u2010G cell\u2010surface expression is mainly restricted to the maternal\u2010foetal interface and to immune privileged adult tissues, where it facilitates immune tolerance [, ]. However, in various pathological situations, aberrant HLA\u2010G expression, which is influenced by genetic variations, has been linked to immune evasion [, , , , ]. We and others showed a substantial increase in the levels of membrane\u2010bound and soluble HLA\u2010G among COVID\u201019 patients, and have linked the differential HLA\u2010G abundance to COVID\u201019 courses [, , , , ]. These findings suggest that HLA\u2010G may be a key player in regulating the immune response to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and that genetic variations in the HLA\u2010G gene may influence individual susceptibilities to severe COVID\u201019. The polymorphic 3\u2032untranslated region (UTR) plays a central role in regulating HLA\u2010G expression []. Within this region, certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the HLA\u2010G 14\u2010base pair (bp) insertion/deletion (INS/DEL) (rs66554220) polymorphism have been identified, which may alter the binding affinity of sequence\u2010specific gene expression regulators for post\u2010transcriptional factors [, , , ]. These polymorphisms define distinct haplotypes. The functional disparities among these haplotypes within the 3\u2032UTR can significantly influence individual susceptibility to viral diseases [, ]. For example, certain polymorphisms within the 3\u2032UTR have been associated with increased susceptibility for Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection [, ]. In addition, HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotype UTR\u20102 carriers have demonstrated reduced susceptibility to Hepatitis C virus infection [], while the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotype UTR\u20103 was more prevalent among patients with chronic Hepatitis C []. In living\u2010donor kidney transplantation the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotype UTR\u20104 of donors or recipients was associated with occurrence of BK polyomavirus replication or nephropathy [].\n\nTo date, few studies have explored the association and biological significance between COVID\u201019 and the potential underlying regulatory mechanisms of HLA\u2010G polymorphisms, and there is only one study on the relevance of HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotypes and COVID\u201019 severity []. However, this study was conducted during the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Delta wave and did not assess patient mortality []. Our cohort was recruited in the first and second waves of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in Germany, which offer a greater chance of being able to define genetic determinants of the host without having to consider pre\u2010existing immunity and viral genetic diversity that occur in later SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 waves. Understanding the factors that drive effective antiviral responses at the population level across different regions is essential. Analysing regional cohorts can uncover specific, often overlooked features. This knowledge is particularly important for identifying vulnerable and at\u2010risk individuals. To introduce the prognostic importance of HLA\u2010G as host genetic factors during SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and its consequences, we examined 3\u2032UTR haplotypes in a total of 505 COVID\u201019 patients in a German cohort.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nStudy Population\n\nPatients were recruited for this monocentric study between May 2020 and March 2021 at the Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Essen. Patients were assessed for eligibility based on a positive reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assay for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, conducted using respiratory tract samples tested either by the local Center for Disease Control (CDC) or by a designated diagnostic laboratory. To be eligible, individuals had to be 18\u2009years of age or older and have a diagnostic specimen that tested positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 using RT\u2010PCR. Additionally, all participants were required to provide written informed consent. Recruitment was performed consecutively and randomly among eligible individuals. Exclusion criteria for the study included individuals who were under 18\u2009years of age, had a prior history of COVID\u201019 and those who did not provide written informed consent. In total, 505 patients were included in the study. The study period spanned the first and second waves of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in Germany, characterised by the wild type of the virus. It is worth noting that during this time there was no SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 vaccine available thus none of the patients included had been vaccinated against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 at time point of infection or had a prior history of COVID\u201019. Patients were classified with the World Health Organisation (WHO) progression scale according to their worst clinical presentation []. Comprehensive demographic and clinical data were documented for all patients. All patients were offered an appointment at the outpatients clinic. Of the total cohort, 253 of the patients attended the post\u2010COVID outpatient clinic, completing outcome measures questionnaires about symptoms persisting after recovery. Long\u2010COVID was defined according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidelines. Additionally, 254 unrelated healthy subjects served as a control panel for genotyping. All participants provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committees (17\u20107859\u2010BO/20\u20109374\u2010BO) and was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n\n\n\nDesoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolation and HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR typing were performed as previously described [, , , ]. Typing of the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR\u2013associated SNP +3422C/T (rs17875408) was determined with a Taqman assay (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nFlow Cytometry\n\nLymphocyte subsets were analysed with the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer System (Beckman Coulter), along with AQUIOS Tetra reagents, according to the manufacturer's instructions. In addition, surface expression of HLA\u2010G on different peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was analysed using an antibody cocktail containing fluorochrome\u2010conjugated antibodies recognising cluster of differentiation (CD)3 (PB450, SK7, Biolegend, Germany), CD19 (BD Horizon APC\u2010R700, HIB19, BD Bioscience, Germany), CD14 (KO525, Beckman Coulter, Germany) and HLA\u2010G (APC, MEM\u2010G/9, Exbio, Praha, Czech Republic). Isotype\u2010matched antibodies from Beckman Coulter, BD Bioscience or BioLegend served as negative controls. Samples were subjected to multicolor flow cytometry using a CytoFlexS cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Data acquisition of at least 200,000 events was performed using CytExpert Version 2.1 software (Beckman Coulter) and analysed with Kaluza Analysis 2.1 software. General gating strategy for flow cytometric analysis is visualised in Figure\u00a0.\n\n\n\n\nSoluble HLA\u2010G was quantified as previously described, using anti\u2010HLA\u2010G MEM\u2010G/09 (Exbio, Praha, Czech Republic) as capture antibody and anti\u2010\u03b22\u2010microglobulin antibody (Dako, Denmark) as secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase [, ].\n\n\nVirus Neutralising Assay\n\nThe neutralising capacity of serum samples was determined by a standard end\u2010point dilution assay, as previously described [].\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Armonk, New York, USA), GraphPad Prism 10.0 (GraphPad Software), or R (Rstudio). Data were presented as median and range. After assessment for Gaussian distribution, differences between two or more groups were evaluated by Mann\u2013Whitney test. Allele and genotype frequencies of polymorphic sites were determined with two\u2010sided Fisher's exact test. Genetic variants were associated to clinical parameters either by two\u2010sided Chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test. Multiple Mantel\u2013Haenszel\u2010Zimmermann tests with Bonferroni corrections of p\u2010values (pc) were performed with BIAS 11.10 software (http://www.bias\u2010online.de/). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was evaluated by the Haploview 4.2 software through inspections of D\u2032 and (LD) plots [, ]. Haplotype phasing from all individuals were assessed by PHASE 2.1 software using default parameters [, ]. Kaplan\u2013Meier curve analysis and log\u2010rank tests were performed by survminer R package version 0.4.9 (https://CRAN.R\u2010project.org/package=survminer). Either stepwise multivariate Cox regression, in accordance with the proportional hazards assumption, or binomial logistic regression was used to identify independent prognostic factors. Statistical significance was set at p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nPatient Characteristics\n\nTable\u00a0 presents demographic data of the 505 COVID\u201019 patients. In accordance with previous studies, common pre\u2010existing comorbid conditions were obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, lung diseases and diabetes [, ]. Consistent with epidemiological evidence, patients had a higher likelihood of more severe COVID\u201019 courses who were \u2265\u200960\u2009years of age (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), of male sex (p\u2009=\u20090.017), obesity with a Body\u2010Mass\u2010Index (BMI) >\u200930 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001); diabetes (p\u2009=\u20090.021), cardiovascular diseases (p\u2009=\u20090.004) or hypertension (p\u2009=\u20090.002).\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the study cohort.\n\nNote: Disease severity according to WHO COVID\u201019 progression scale: WHO 1\u20135, mild or moderate condition; WHO 6\u20139, severe COVID\u201019 condition; WHO 10, fatal COVID\u201019 outcome. Significance (p) determined by Mantel\u2013Haenszel\u2010Zimmerman test; p, significance determined by multiple Mantel\u2013Haenszel\u2010Zimmerman comparison; pc, p value after Bonferroni correction. Statistical significance is indicated by bolding.\n\nAbbreviation: BMI, body mass index.\n\nInformation not available for all patients.\n\nMultiple Mantel\u2013Haenszel\u2010Zimmermann comparisons (WHO 1\u20135 vs. WHO 10; WHO 6\u20139 vs. WHO 10) showed that age (pc\u2009<\u20090.001 or pc\u2009=\u20090.007), obesity (pc\u2009<\u20090.001 or pc\u2009=\u20090.005), diabetes (pc\u2009=\u20090.021 or pc\u2009=\u20090.076), and hypertension (pc\u2009=\u20090.001 or pc\u2009=\u20090.048) were exclusively associated with fatal outcomes, whereas sex (pc\u2009=\u20090.017) and cardiovascular preconditions (pc\u2009=\u20090.046) posed a significant risk for severe COVID\u201019.\n\n\n\n\nTo define the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotypes, we analysed 9 previously described polymorphic variations in the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR, along with the associated SNP +3422 C/T variant downstream of the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR. All 10 polymorphic sites displayed similar pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in both COVID\u201019 patients and control subjects, as well as in the combined dataset (Figure\u00a0) All HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR SNP frequencies were in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (data not shown). Haplotype phasing revealed eight distinct haplotypes with frequencies exceeding 1% (Table\u00a0) with UTR\u20101 and UTR\u20102 being the most frequent haplotypes as described in other populations by Castelli et\u00a0al. [] The HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotypes known as UTR\u201010, UTR\u201013 and UTR\u201017 displayed haplotype frequencies below 1%. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences between patients and controls in HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR SNPs frequencies, haplotype frequencies or distribution or in the distribution of the SNP +3422C/T variant (). We compared our HLA\u2010G haplotype and SNP frequencies with previously published data from Castelli et\u00a0al. [], which provides a global overview of HLA\u2010G haplotype and LD distribution, and observed similar frequencies within pooled European cohorts.\n\nLinkage disequilibrium (LD) of 10 analysed polymorphic variations in or closed to the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR. The image was generated in the Haploview 4.2. D\u2032 pairwise correlation between polymorphic sites. Areas in red indicated strong LD (LOD\u2009\u2265\u20092, D\u2032\u2009=\u20091), areas in light red indicate moderate LD (LOD\u2009\u2265\u20092, D\u2032\u2009<\u20091), areas in blue indicate LD with a lack of statistical evidence (LOD\u2009\u2264\u20092, D\u2032\u2009=\u20091), while areas in white indicate no LD (LOD\u2009\u2264\u20092, D\u2032\u2009<\u20091). D\u2032 values different from 1.00 are represented inside the squares as percentages. LOD, log of the odds; D\u2032, pairwise correlation between single\u2010nucleotide polymporphisms.

Only haplotypes with frequencies >\u20091% were listed. p\na\u2010values were calculated by GraphPad Prism using two\u2010sided Fisher's exact test when evaluating haplotypes frequencies genotypes; alpha\u2009<\u20090.05.\n\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; COVID\u201019, Coronavirus disease 2019; HC, healthy controls; n.a, not available; OR, odds ratio; UTR, untranslated region.\n\nLiterature: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598\u2010021\u201002106\u20104, Ref. [].\n\nAll outcome parameters were analysed for the individual HLA\u2010G 3\u00b4UTR SNPs and UTR haplotypes. Aside from the +3422 C/T variant, there were no associations found for the individual SNPs (data not shown); associations were observed only for the UTR haplotypes. Therefore, the following results section will focus on the findings related to the +3422 C/T variant and the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotypes.\n\n\nDifferential Association of +3422 C/T Variant With\n\nWhen the SNP rs17875408 C/T at position +3422 downstream of the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR region was included in haplotype phasing, it became evident that haplotype UTR\u20103 and the rare haplotype UTR\u201013 are exclusively associated with the +3422T allelic variant. In contrast, the +3422C allelic variant demonstrated a wider UTR association. Only UTR\u20105 and UTR\u20106 were associated with both allelic variants (Figure\u00a0).\n\nAssociation between the SNP +3422C/T and the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotypes: The +3422C variant was associated with the 7 UTR haplotypes found in our patient cohort (UTR\u20101, UTR\u20102, UTR\u20104, UTR\u20107, UTR\u201010, UTR\u201017 and UTR\u201018), whereas both the +3422C variant and the T variant were associated with UTR5 and 6. Notably, UTR 3 and the rare UTR\u201013 were exclusively linked to the +3422T variant.\n\n\nT Cell Counts and Association With the\n\nT cells are important for controlling most viral infections, including SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Thus, the association of HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTRs with absolute counts of CD3+, CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, along with the CD4/CD8 ratio, in acute and post\u2013COVID\u201019 phases was analysed (Figure\u00a0). During acute COVID\u201019, no direct association was observed between a certain HLA\u2010G 3\u00b4UTR haplotype and T cell counts. The post\u2010acute COVID\u201019 phase, however, highlighted reductions in CD3+ (p\u2009=\u20090.009) and CD8+ T cells (p\u2009=\u20090.028) among UTR\u20101\u2013positive patients compared to the UTR\u20101 negative ones (Mann\u2013Whitney test). A similar trend was observed in UTR\u20107\u2010positive patients; however, an association was only reached for CD8+ T cells (p\u2009=\u20090.016). Conversely, patients carrying the haplotype UTR\u20103 or the +3422T variant showed increases in CD3+ (UTR\u20103: p\u2009=\u20090.06; +3422T: p\u2009=\u20090.03) and CD8+ T\u2010cell numbers (UTR\u20103: p\u2009=\u20090.017; +3422T: p\u2009=\u20090.002; Mann\u2013Whitney test) as compared to the UTR\u20103 and +3422T negative ones, respectively. Data for CD4+ T cells are not shown, because only UTR\u20101 was linked to lower counts in the post\u2010acute COVID\u201019 situation.\n\nAssociation between HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR\u20101, \u20107 or \u20103 haplotypes or the SNP +3422T allele and CD3+ or CD8+ T\u2010cell counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio. During acute COVID\u201019, specific HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotypes were not directly linked to T\u2010cell counts. After COVID\u201019, reduced CD3+ and CD8+ T\u2010cell counts were seen in patients carrying UTR\u20101 or UTR\u20107, but only UTR\u20107 carriers exhibited a significant increase in CD4/CD8 ratio. Interestingly, among patients with acute COVID\u201019, UTR\u20103 or +3422T carriers exhibited higher CD4/CD8 ratios, but this finding was reversed after COVID\u201019, a finding indicating changing immune profiles across the disease phases. Solid line indicates median value of cell count. Patient groups are distinguished by colour codes: Red for patients during COVID\u201019 and blue for patients after COVID\u201019 (here, post\u2010COVID\u201019); p: Significance difference between carriers and non\u2010carriers of a certain HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotype or SNP allele by by Mann\u2013Whitney tests.\n\nNo significant differences were found between the acute COVID\u201019 period and the post\u2010COVID\u201019 situation in the CD4/CD8 ratio and its association with UTR\u20101. In contrast to UTR\u20101 carriers, UTR\u20107 carriers exhibited a higher CD4/CD8 ratio during the post\u2013COVID\u201019 situation than did non\u2010carriers (p\u2009=\u20090.019, Mann\u2013Whitney test).\n\nDuring acute COVID\u201019, UTR\u20103 or +3422T carriers exhibited a higher CD4/CD8 ratio than non\u2010carriers (UTR\u20103: p\u2009=\u20090.013; +3422T: p\u2009=\u20090.021; Mann\u2013Whitney test). However, in the post\u2010acute COVID\u201019 phase, an inverse association emerged, indicating a lower CD4/CD8 ratio for UTR\u20103 (p\u2009=\u20090.08) or +3422T carriers (p\u2009=\u20090.006).\n\n\nFrequencies of\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated associations between HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR polymorphic sites and sHLA\u2010G concentrations [, , ]. However, in our cohort, we found no association between certain UTRs and sHLA\u2010G levels either during COVID\u201019 or in the post\u2010sequel phase (data not shown).\n\nAs previously reported HLA\u2010G frequencies on CD3 T cells, B cells, and monocytes in patients with acute COVID\u201019 did not significantly differ from convalescent patients post COVID\u201019 []. Regarding association of HLA\u2010G UTR Haplotypes and +3422 variants, post COVID\u201019 patients with UTR\u20105 haplotype (n\u2009=\u20094) showed higher frequencies (median [range]%) of HLA\u2010G\u2010positive CD3 (2.0 [1.4\u20139.6]; p\u2009=\u20090.003) and CD19 cells (2.2 [1.8\u20138.8]; p\u2009=\u20090.04) than 27 UTR5\u2010negative patients (CD3: 1.1 [0.5\u20132.1] and CD19: 1.6 [0.7\u20134.4]; Mann\u2013Whitney test). Similarly, frequencies of HLA\u2010G\u2010positive CD3 (1.6 [1.2\u20139.6]; p\u2009=\u20090.004) and CD19 cells (2.2 [1.6\u20138.8]; p\u2009=\u20090.014) were increased in post\u2010COVID19 patients having +3422T SNP allele (N\u2009=\u20098) compared to patients (N\u2009=\u200923) without +3422T SNP variant (CD3: 0.9 [0.5\u20132.1] and CD19: 1.6 [0.7\u20134.4]). In contrast, only the UTR\u20102 haplotype was associated with lower frequencies of HLA\u2010G\u2010positive CD19\u2010positive cells (1.4 [0.7\u20133.1], N\u2009=\u200918 vs. 1.9 [0.9\u20135.8], N\u2009=\u200913; p\u2009=\u20090.013). For monocytes, no association between HLA\u2010G\u2010UTR haplotypes or +3422T\u2010SNP was observed by the Mann\u2013Whitney test during acute and post COVID\u201019.\n\n\n\n\nAmong SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected patients, only UTR\u20103 or +3422T carriers exhibited an increased 30\u2010day mortality rate (WHO 10 on the COVID\u201019 progression scale) after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (Table\u00a0). Of note, both were exclusively associated with fatal outcome by multiple Mantel\u2013Haenszel\u2010Zimmermann comparisons. For the remaining HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotypes, we found no association with COVID\u201019 severity or 30\u2010day mortality.\n\nAssociation of HLA\u2010G UTR Haplotypes and SNP 3422T allele with COVID\u201019 disease severity.\n\nNote: Significance (p value) determined by *Mantel\u2013Haenszel\u2010Zimmerman Test or by **multiple Mantel\u2013Haenszel\u2010Zimmerman comparison.

Similarly, +3422T allele carriers showed a reduced OS probability (p\u2009=\u20090.005; HR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.2\u20135.1) compared to non +3422T allele carriers (Figure\u00a0).\n\nAssociation of UTR\u20103 Haplotype and SNP +3422T carriers with 30\u2010day mortality rates among COVID\u201019 patients. Kaplan\u2013Meier plot analysis combined with log\u2010rank test revealed a reduced 30\u2010day OS probability for acute COVID\u201019 patients carrying the (A) UTR\u20103 haplotype of HLA\u2010G or (B) SNP +3422T variant. Tables under Kaplan\u2013Meier plots show corresponding numbers at risk. Patient groups are distinguished by colour codes as follows: (A) blue for UTR\u20103 negative and red for UTR\u20103 positive patients; (B) blue for SNP +3422CC carriers and red for SNP +3422TT/CT carriers.\n\n\n\n\nConsidering risk factors for severe COVID\u201019 identified in previous studies (sex, age \u2265\u200960\u2009years, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression), besides the known risk factors of advanced age (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and obesity (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) multivariate Cox regression analysis identified UTR\u20103 carrier status (p\u2009=\u20090.002) as an independent risk factor for 30\u2010day mortality due to COVID\u201019 (Figure\u00a0). Similar results were obtained for SNP +3422T carrier status (p\u2009=\u20090.004; Figure\u00a0).\n\nForest plot of risk factors for 30\u2010day mortality of COVID\u201019 patients. The forest plots show the results of multivariate analyses of the following covariates for 30\u2010day mortality: Diabetes, sex, age \u2265\u200960\u2009years of age, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression, and (A) HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR carrier status or (B) SNP +3422T carrier status. 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.\n\n\n+\n\nWe were able to test 186 patients for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 neutralising antibodies (nAb) at a median of 5\u2009months (range, 1\u201312\u2009months) after infection. Here, the +3422T allele was significantly associated with the absence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nAb (p\u2009=\u20090.027; OR, 3.94; 95% CI, 1.31\u201311.81) by unadjusted two\u2010sided Fisher's exact test, whereas none of the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotypes could be related to the absence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nAb (Table\u00a0).\n\nAssociation of HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR Haplotypes and SNP +3422T with loss of neutralising SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Ab 1\u2009year after infection.\n\nNote: Nominal significance (p value) determined by Fisher's exact test.

In the multivariate Cox regression analysis (Figure\u00a0) including sex, age \u2265\u200960\u2009years, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression, and +3422T carrier\u2010status, only +3422T carrier\u2010status emerged as the exclusive independent predictive covariate affecting the early loss of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nAb (p\u2009=\u20090.006).\n\nAssociation SNP +3422T carrier status with the early loss of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 neutralising antibodies. (A) Kaplan\u2013Meier plot analysis combined with log\u2010rank test revealed a significant reduced detection of anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 for patients carrying the SNP +3422T variant post infection. Patient groups are distinguished by colour codes: Blue for SNP +3422CC carriers and red for SNP +3422 TT/CT carriers. Tables under Kaplan\u2013Meier plots show corresponding numbers at risk. (B) Forest plot of risk factors for loss of neutralising anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antibodies in COVID\u201019 patients. The forest plots show the results of multivariate analyses of the following covariates for neutralising antibody loss: Sex, age \u2265\u200960\u2009years of age, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression and SNP +3422T carrier status. 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.\n\n\n\n\nAmong the 253 patients who attended the post\u2010COVID outpatient clinic, 182 (72%) reported persistent symptoms at a median of 4\u2009months after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (range, 1\u201311). Age \u2265\u200960\u2009years and diabetes were associated with absence of symptoms after infection, whereas women were more likely than men to experience persistent symptoms after recovery from acute COVID\u201019. Notably, within our cohort, initial COVID\u201019 severity, immunosuppression and other comorbid conditions could not associated with persistent symptoms among convalescent COVID\u201019 patients (Table\u00a0).\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the Long\u2010COVID\u201019 study cohort.\n\nNote: Significance (p value) determined by Fisher's exact test. Statistical significance is indicated by bolding.\n\nAbbreviation: OR, odds ratio.\n\nInformation not available for all patients.\n\nAs genetic risk factors contributing to Long\u2010COVID are not well established, we proved whether HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotypes or +3422C/T variants were associated the presence of Long\u2010COVID symptoms. Among the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotypes and the +3422C/T variant, the UTR\u20107 haplotype was exclusively associated with Long\u2010COVID symptoms (Figure\u00a0). The frequency of HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR\u20107 was statistically significantly increased among patients with persistent symptoms (14%) than among those without (1%). Notably, the likelihood ratio of 10.03 suggests that haplotype UTR\u20107 could serve as a robust prognostic genetic marker for Long\u2010COVID. Considering previously discussed covariates for Long\u2010COVID (sex, age and medical preconditions) and haplotype UTR\u20107 carrier status, binomial logistic regression (Figure\u00a0) identified UTR\u20107 (p\u2009=\u20090.023) as an independent prognostic covariate for Long\u2010COVID, besides sex (p\u2009=\u20090.001) and diabetes (p\u2009=\u20090.011).\n\n(A) Association of HLA\u2010G UTR\u20107 carrier status with the presence of Long\u2010COVID\u2010symptoms. Patient groups are distinguished by colour codes: Blue for UTR\u20107 negative and red for UTR\u20107 positive patients (B) Forest plot of risk factors for Long\u2010COVID\u2010 symptoms. The forest plots show the results of multivariate analyses of the following covariates for Long\u2010COVID symptoms: Diabetes, sex, age \u2265\u200960\u2009years of age, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression and HLA\u2010G UTR\u20107 carrier status. 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe demonstrated for the first time that the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotype UTR\u20103 and the SNP +3422T variant are independent prognostic factors for fatal COVID\u201019. Regarding post\u2013SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection events, SNP +3422T is associated with nAb loss, whereas the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotype UTR\u20107 is associated with Long\u2010COVID symptoms in both univariate and multivariate analyses.\n\nNumerous studies have evaluated the clinical and immunological aspects of COVID\u201019, revealing its complexity as a result of viral factors and various host\u2010related characteristics involving genetic, demographic, and immunological aspects. Specific host genetic factors have been identified as contributors to both susceptibility to and severity of COVID\u201019 [, , ]. However, there is limited information available regarding the biological and clinical significance, as well as the potential underlying regulatory mechanisms, of HLA\u2010G expression.\n\nHLA\u2010G is an endogenous immunosuppressive molecule with a pivotal role in immune system regulation. Previous research has highlighted the influence of HLA\u2010G gene variations in modulating HLA\u2010G expression levels and thus has identified HLA\u2010G as a prognostic factor in a range of medical conditions [, , , ]. These investigations have underscored the significance of HLA\u2010G as an immune\u2010checkpoint [, , , ].\n\nThe HLA\u2010G molecule however, has a dual role, exerting either beneficial or harmful effects depending on the context. Identifying individuals who are genetically predisposed to different HLA\u2010G expression patterns could help develop new strategies to modulate immune responses and tailor therapies accordingly.\n\nHLA\u2010G expression modulation has been consistently observed in various viral infections, including SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 []. It was hypothesised that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may exploit HLA\u2010G as part of its immune escape mechanism. This concept gained support from a genome\u2010wide association study showing a strong genetic association between the presence of SNP +3187G (rs9380142) within the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR region and the severity of COVID\u201019 [].\n\nThe polymorphic nature of the 3\u2032UTR is pivotal in modulating HLA\u2010G expression levels. HLA\u2010G expression levels are regulated by post\u2010transcriptional mechanisms, including alternative splicing and microRNAs (miRNAs) interaction. miRNAs can modulate gene expression through mRNA degradation or by inhibiting translation. Key miRNAs involved in regulating HLA\u2010G expression include miR\u2010148a, miR\u2010148b, miR\u2010152, miR\u2010133a, miR\u2010628\u20105p and miR\u2010548q. Variations in the target sequences of these miRNAs can influence their binding strength, thereby affecting gene expression. The 3\u2032UTR, as the primary target for miRNA binding, contains polymorphic sites critical for the post\u2010transcriptional regulation of HLA\u2010G expression []. For instance, the +3010 variant affects mRNA stability through alternative splicing, while the +3142 SNP alters miRNA binding affinity. Additionally, the +3187 variant impacts mRNA stability. Although these non\u2010coding variants do not change the protein sequence, they significantly influence immune response modulation. Increased HLA\u2010G expression can enhance immune tolerance, which may benefit pathogens while hindering host defence, which may lead to poorer treatment outcomes.\n\nHowever, the role of genetic variations in HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR in COVID\u201019 has been a subject of conflicting findings, a fact that emphasises the multifaceted relationship between genetics and COVID\u201019 outcomes. Patients carrying a 14\u2010bp del/del genotype have been described to be at risk of contracting COVID\u201019 []. Conversely, a study conducted in Italy described the 14\u2010bp DEL carrier status and the haplotype UTR\u20101, which contains both, the 14\u2010bp del and the SNP +3187G allele, as protective genetic markers against severe COVID\u201019 []. At variance to these studies, we performed a more detailed stratification into severe and fatal COVID\u201019 in our study. In addition, our cohort is unique as it was recruited during the early stages of the pandemic. This timing offers a greater opportunity to identify host genetic determinants independent of pre\u2010existing immunity and in the absence of viral genetic diversity, which can be influenced by pre\u2010existing immunity and affect outcomes. At the same time, our cohort is representative in terms of both outcomes and risk factors. Because our patients presented the entire spectrum of outcomes, from oligosymptomatic to fatal, we were able to compare severely affected patients to those mildly affected. In line with previous studies, our study found that advanced age, obesity, diabetes and hypertension were associated with an elevated mortality risk. It has to be accnoleged that healthcare systems vary across regions.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that healthcare and pandemic management and individual risk factors vary across regions. integrating clinical parameters enriches our findings by contextualising the genetic data within the broader spectrum of risk factors. There are significant differences in the regional and ancestral frequency distribution of HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR variants among different populations []. Therefore, it is crucial to consider genetic diversity across regions when investigating these associations. Interestingly, UTR\u20103 and UTR\u20107 variants have previously been showed to exhibit varying worldwide prevalence, with haplotype UTR\u20103 being more common in individuals with African and Asian ancestry, while UTR\u20107 has a low frequency in Europe and being nearly absent in Africa []. In our study, we did not assessed ancestry; however, we found that the distribution of HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR variants in our patient cohort was consistent with that of our control cohort and aligned with the previously published pooled European cohorts.\n\nIn our study we analysed HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotypes and SNP +3422C/T located downstream of 3\u2032UTR, each of which are non\u2010coding but impact HLA\u2010G expression, as host genetic factors for COVID\u201019 outcomes.\n\nThis led to the identification of the UTR\u20103 haplotype as an independent risk factor for 30\u2010day mortality in COVID\u201019 patients. So far, no specific mechanisms resulting in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010mediated HLA\u2010G up\u2010regulation have been identified. However, in severe cases of COVID\u201019, a cytokine storm can occur characterised by a hyperinflammatory response and an excessive release of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Elevated levels of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106), tumour necrosis factor\u2010alpha (TNF\u2010\u03b1), and interleukin\u20101\u03b2 (IL\u20101\u03b2) have been associated with this phenomenon and it has been suggesting that these factors might be involved in COVID\u201019\u2010mediated enhanced HLA\u2010G expression within the microenviroment of body compartments [].\n\nThere is the hypothesis that other polymorphic sites present in the 3\u2032UTR may counterbalance the effect of the specific variation site []. The UTR\u20103 haplotype has been linked to intermediate levels of soluble HLA\u2010G (sHLA\u2010G) expression []. Notably, this haplotype contains 14\u2009bp Del/+3142 C variation sites being both associated with increased HLA\u2010G expression, it also harbours the +3187A SNP, associated with reduced mRNA structural stability, which results in lower HLA\u2010G levels [, ]. In addition, UTR\u20103 has been associated with the high sHLA\u2010G producing allele HLA\u2010G*01:04 []. However, in a cohort of lung transplant recipients the combination of HLA\u2010G*01:04\u223cUTR3 haplotype was associated with lower levels of sHLA\u2010G additionally indicating differential expression mechanisms upon physiological and pathological conditions [].\n\nBesides the UTR\u20103 haplotype, the HLA\u2010G*01:04 also harbours the SNP +3422T variant, which emerged as an independent covariant for 30\u2010day mortality, potentially indicating it as an expression quantitative trait locus. Of note +3422T is associated (though not exclusively) to UTR\u20103. The +3422 SNP, while not located within the 3\u2032UTR of the HLA\u2010G gene, remains of considerable interest due to its potential regulatory effects. Although functional experiments directly assessing the impact of this SNP are currently lacking, data from RegulomeDB indicate that it resides in a region highly accessible to DNase I digestion in specific cell types, including vaginal tissue, the sigmoid colon, and stimulated activated effector memory CD8 T cells. This accessibility suggests that the SNP may play a role in gene regulation. Moreover, the +3422 SNP is annotated as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), further implying its potential influence on gene expression. Sequence analysis of transcription factor (TF) motifs indicates that this SNP may alter the binding affinities of two transcription factors, SOX13 and SOX6. Although the precise functional implications of the +3422 SNP have yet to be fully elucidated, these findings support the hypothesis that it may modulate HLA\u2010G expression by affecting transcription factor binding.\n\nEarlier studies considered this variant a HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR SNP [, ]. However, because this particular SNP is situated downstream beyond exon 8 of HLA\u2010G; it does not fulfil the criteria set by Castelli [], who defined the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR as extending to the HLA\u2010G position +3292 within the last exon. This definition suggests that the SNP is not transcribed into mature mRNA. SNP +3422 C/T is also in LD with the SNP +755A/C (non\u2010synonymous) that defines the G*01:04 allele. Recent study reported an association between SNP +3422C/T genotype and an increased risk of cervical cancer, a disease linked to human papillomavirus infection [].\n\nTo further elucidate the biological significance of SNP +3422C/T, the Ldlink\u2010NIH\u2010Database revealed an LD with SNPs located on chromosome 6 and associated with severe COVID\u201019 (rs2523404, rs2735059) [], positive response to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010vaccination (rs1737060) [], and CD8 expression on CD8+ central\u2010memory T cells (rs9260013) []. The observed associations, especially in terms of mortality and nAb loss within our cohort, may find their explanation through LD. However, the complex HLA locus poses challenges in gene studies because of its high gene density. This highly polymorphic region exhibits extensive LD among variants, making it challenging to precisely detect specific genes or alleles associated with observed outcomes. Consequently, the spectrum of genetic predisposition factors within the HLA\u2010locus in reported studies is notably heterogeneous [, ]. Of note, in our study, SNP +3422T was significantly associated with increased incidence of HLA\u2010G positive CD3 and CD19 in convalescents patients after COVID\u201019 potential indicating it as an expression quantitative trait locus. The expression of HLA\u2010G on CD3 and CD19 cells raise the question, whether these cells display immune regulative capacities affecting T and B functions.\n\nAn effective immune response against viral infections depends on the activation of cytotoxic T cells that can clear infection by killing virus\u2010infected cells. HLA\u2010G can trigger CD8+ T\u2010cell apoptosis []. To draw conclusions regarding T\u2010cell populations, we investigated the correlation between HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR haplotypes and T\u2010cell count and ratio. Our findings showed a statistically significant association exclusively within convalescent patients. This finding strongly suggests that various compartments within the microenvironment in the body and immunological pathways exert different influences on HLA\u2010G and, consequently, on immune effector cells, depending on different pathological and physiological conditions. This entire process occurs within the context of diverse genetic backgrounds. Similar to haplotype UTR\u20103, the UTR\u20107 haplotype is characterised by carrying +3010C/+3187A and has been associated with the lowest sHLA\u2010G levels according to studies []. UTR\u20107 has previously been associated with sepsis\u2010related mortality. In our cohort, the UTR\u20107 haplotype was present in 14% of Long\u2010COVID patients, with a likelihood ratio greater than 10.\n\nAlthough this study was conducted at a single centre, the variations in treatment strategies observed during the early pandemic phase may have contributed to heterogeneity in outcomes. Nevertheless, our findings underscore the concept that the immune\u2010modulatory HLA\u2010G influences the immunopathogenesis of both COVID\u201019 and Long\u2010COVID. Additional investigations of SNP +3422C/T in larger cohorts and across other infectious diseases are warranted to evaluate its potential as a risk\u2010stratification marker that would allow the development of easy\u2010to\u2010determine predictive algorithms.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nTo our knowledge this is the first study defining 3\u2032UTR haplotypes of the immune\u2010checkpoint HLA\u2010G and the associated SNP +3422C/T variant in context of COVID\u201019\u2010associated mortality, the loss of nAb after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and the presence of Long\u2010COVID symptoms. The genetic background of the HLA\u2010G 3\u2032UTR and regulatory elements in the microenvironment targeting this region highlight their influence on the time\u2010dependent course of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Thus, our study on HLA\u2010G emphasises the relevance of immune\u2010checkpoints in COVID\u201019 and may introduce additional immune\u2010checkpoint axes for consideration in ongoing research into the immunological and genetic aspects of the pathogenesis of COVID\u201019 and Long\u2010COVID. Identifying individuals genetically predisposed to different HLA\u2010G expression patterns could help develop new strategies to modulate immune responses and tailor therapies accordingly.\n\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nH.R., P.A.H., O.W., V.R.: conceived and designed research.

The GAS M1UK lineage has contributed significantly to the recently reported increases in scarlet fever and invasive infections. However, the basis for its evolutionary success is not yet fully understood. During the transition to systemic disease, the M1 serotype is known to give rise to spontaneous mutations in the control of virulence two-component regulatory system (CovRS) that confer a fitness advantage during invasive infections. Mutations that inactivate CovS function result in the de-repression of key GAS virulence factors such as streptolysin O (SLO), a pore-forming toxin and major trigger of inflammasome/interleukin-1\u03b2-dependent inflammation. Conversely, expression of the streptococcal cysteine protease SpeB, which is required during initial stages of colonization and onset of invasive disease, is typically lost in such mutants. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel covS single nucleotide polymorphism detected in three separate invasive M1UK isolates. The resulting CovSAla318Val mutation caused a significant upregulation of SLO resulting in increased inflammasome activation in human THP-1 macrophages, indicating an enhanced inflammatory potential. Surprisingly, SpeB production was unaffected. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to assess the impact of this mutation on virulence and global gene expression. We found that the CovSAla318Val mutation led to subtle, virulence-specific changes of the CovRS regulon compared to previously characterized covS mutations, highlighting an unappreciated level of complexity in CovRS-dependent gene regulation. Continued longitudinal surveillance is warranted to determine whether this novel covS mutation will expand in the M1UK lineage.IMPORTANCEThe M1UK lineage of GAS has contributed to a recent global upsurge in scarlet fever and invasive infections. Understanding how GAS can become more virulent is critical for infection control and identifying new treatment approaches. The two-component CovRS system, comprising the sensor kinase CovS and transcription factor CovR, is a central regulator of GAS virulence genes. In the M1 serotype, covRS mutations are associated with an invasive phenotype. Such mutations have not been fully characterized in the M1UK lineage. This study identified a novel covS mutation in invasive Australian M1UK isolates that resulted in a more nuanced virulence gene regulation compared to previously characterized covS mutations. A representative isolate displayed upregulated SLO production and triggered amplified interleukin-1\u03b2 secretion in infected human macrophages, indicating an enhanced inflammatory potential. These findings underscore the need for comprehensive analyses of covRS mutants to fully elucidate their contribution to M1UK virulence and persistence.", "good_summary": "This study investigates a novel single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the covS gene of a subset of invasive Australian M1UK Streptococcus pyogenes isolates. The CovRS two-component system regulates expression of numerous virulence factors in GAS, with inactivating mutations enhancing virulence by altering gene expression. The identified CovSAla318Val mutation increases expression of streptolysin O (SLO) and several other virulence genes (nga-ifs-slo operon, ska, sic, spyA), while not affecting speB or hasA expression, suggesting partial rather than complete CovS inactivation. This partial modulation of CovS function contrasts with previously characterized mutations that fully abrogate CovS activity.\n\nFunctional assays showed that isolates harboring this mutation secreted significantly higher SLO levels and stimulated increased IL-1\u03b2 secretion from human THP-1 macrophages, indicating amplified inflammasome activation and inflammatory potential. However, unlike typical CovS mutants, SpeB production remained unaffected, possibly preserving colonization capabilities. RNA-sequencing confirmed limited but specific global transcriptional changes due to CovSAla318Val.\n\nThis mutation\u2019s presence in multiple invasive isolates suggests evolutionary advantage, fine-tuning virulence and immune evasion without full CovS loss. The study provides new insights into M1UK lineage virulence regulation, highlighting complex modulation of GAS pathogenicity via CovRS. These findings deepen understanding of GAS invasive disease dynamics and may inform future therapeutic targeting of regulatory pathways in emerging hypervirulent clones.", "medium_summary": "This study investigates a novel mutation, CovSAla318Val, found in a subset of invasive Australian M1UK Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, a lineage associated with scarlet fever outbreaks and invasive infections. The M1UK clone differs from the earlier M1global clone by 27 SNPs and exhibits increased SpeA superantigen expression. Researchers found additional SNPs in regulators including covS, rofA, and rocA in some Australian M1UK isolates. By generating isogenic mutants, they showed that the CovSAla318Val mutation in the sensor kinase CovS leads to approximately 6-fold higher expression of the virulence factor streptolysin O (SLO) without affecting the cysteine protease SpeB, which often decreases in classic covS mutants. RNA sequencing revealed that CovSAla318Val modestly alters the CovRS regulon, upregulating genes like slo, ska, and spyA, but not others such as hasA or speB. Functional assays using human THP-1 macrophages demonstrated that the SP1450 isolate carrying this mutation provokes enhanced IL-1\u03b2 secretion compared to M1global and standard M1UK strains, suggesting increased inflammasome activation linked to higher SLO levels. This novel mutation does not fully inactivate CovS but modulates its function, potentially offering a virulence advantage while preserving some colonization traits. These findings improve understanding of how CovS variants influence GAS pathogenesis in the emerging M1UK lineage, although the exact mechanisms through which CovSAla318Val impacts disease outcomes require further study.", "bad_summary": "This paper investigates the genetic differences in Streptococcus pyogenes, particularly focusing on the M1 serotype known as M1global and M1UK. The study mainly looks at various SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms), such as rsC953T and others, found in Australian isolates. It was found that these mutations caused a large increase in expression of SpeA superantigen, which is believed to drive scarlet fever outbreaks. The authors also studied mutations in CovR, the transcription factor, which they mistakenly thought increased SpeB cysteine protease production, contrary to previous literature. They compared strains like SF370, 5448, and isolates from 1990s and found that the mutations caused up to a 20-fold increase in SpeB and downregulated SLO production, which is a key toxin. Inflammasome activation levels in macrophages were reduced in strains with CovS mutations. \n\nThe main SNP causing these effects was rsCovS:Ala318Ile (note: wrong amino acid substitution), which disrupted the NADase gene leading to lower virulence. The authors claimed that this mutation completely inactivated CovS, unlike previous reports. They also mistakenly equated the M1UK clone with M1global, mixing up their genetic differences. Overall, the study lacked detailed analysis of the entire 27 core genome SNPs difference between lineages and ignored the potential role of host IL-1\u03b2 signaling in infection progression. Hence, the mechanisms behind the clonal success of M1UK remain unclear from this study.", "original_text": "\nINTRODUCTION\n\nStreptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus [GAS]) is an important human-adapted pathogen that causes a wide spectrum of diseases in humans, ranging from mild infections of epithelial or mucosal tissues such as pharyngitis (strep throat) and impetigo to severe invasive diseases including bacteremia and necrotizing fasciitis. Repeated and untreated GAS infections can result in immune response-mediated pathologies that can progress to chronic autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatic heart disease (RHD) (). RHD accounts for the majority of GAS-related morbidity and mortality worldwide (). An estimated 616 million infections and more than 500,000 deaths per year are attributed to GAS, which predominantly affect young children and people living in countries with poor healthcare infrastructure ().\n\nThe M1 serotype of GAS underwent several horizontal gene transfer events in the mid-1980s, which resulted in the emergence of the hyperinvasive M1T1 clone (referred to as \u201cM1global\u201d in this study). Clones isolated after 1988 had acquired novel prophages carrying the superantigen allele speA2 and the DNase gene sda1/sdaD2 (, ). In addition, genetic recombination equipped these clones with a high-expression nga-ifs-slo operon encoding a NAD+-glycohydrolase (NADase) with an associated endogenous inhibitor and the cytolytic toxin streptolysin O (SLO) that has been associated with increased virulence in M1global and certain acapsular GAS isolates (, ). M1global became the major driver of invasive GAS infections in high-income countries (, , , ). However, since 2008, a new M1 sublineage, referred to as M1UK, has emerged and significantly contributed to scarlet fever outbreaks in the UK and a surge in invasive infections in various countries (). M1UK differs from M1global by the presence of 27 core genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (, ). Although the transcriptional heterogeneity between M1global and M1UK is reportedly low (, ), the M1UK lineage is characterized by increased in vitro expression of the SpeA superantigen caused by a single SNP in the ssrA gene (encoding a transfer-messenger RNA) that results in ssrA terminator read-through and subsequent higher expression of the speA gene located downstream of ssrA (). However, the specific mechanisms driving the clonal success of M1UK remain incompletely understood.\n\nThe control of virulence two-component regulatory system (CovRS), which consists of the sensor kinase CovS and the transcription factor CovR, regulates up to 15% of the GAS genome () and coordinates the response to stress conditions, such as limited nutrient availability and host-pathogen interaction (, ). During homeostasis and in non-invasive settings, CovS activity maintains the DNA-bound state of CovR () to suppress the expression of numerous virulence-associated genes (), including those encoding SLO (slo), streptokinase (ska), and the hyaluronic acid capsule (hasA) (). Mutations in covS that can spontaneously occur during invasive disease progression of M1global GAS typically result in the upregulation of these virulence factors (, , ). Additionally, inactivating covS mutations often cause the loss of the broad-spectrum protease SpeB (, , ), thus preventing the SpeB-mediated degradation of other GAS virulence factors (, ). Combined, these events confer an invasive phenotype with enhanced immune evasion and a decreased ability to colonize nasopharyngeal tissues (, ). A recent publication noted that the frequency of covRS mutations was lower in M1UK compared to M1global invasive isolates collected in the UK between 2014 and 2023 (); however, it is currently unknown whether this trend generally applies to M1UK. CovRS mutants derived from the M1UK lineage have not yet been fully characterized.\n\nIn addition to CovRS regulation, the progression of invasive GAS infections is also controlled by host factors, such as the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) that is produced by the inflammasome pathway (). IL-1\u03b2 signaling plays a crucial but complex role in GAS disease. It is required to prevent the systemic spread of GAS (, ), but once invasive infection is established, high levels of IL-1\u03b2 correlate with increased disease severity (, ). Of note, CovRS mutants demonstrate an enhanced ability to survive the consequences of IL-1\u03b2 signaling, such as neutrophil-mediated clearance (, ). In addition, IL-1\u03b2 secretion was shown to promote GAS colonization of the nasopharynx (). Accordingly, the inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 axis has been suggested as a potential target for therapeutic intervention (, , ). The streptolysins SLO and SLS secreted by GAS have been shown to trigger IL-1\u03b2 production in a variety of cell types () and are the major contributors to inflammasome activation in human macrophages (). The extent of IL-1\u03b2 signaling stimulated by M1UK isolates has not yet been investigated.\n\nIn this study, we identified a novel covS SNP in a subset of invasive Australian M1UK isolates that altered the transcription of genes in the CovRS regulon to a smaller degree than previously characterized covS mutations. Isolates carrying this mutation expressed significantly higher levels of SLO and stimulated increased inflammasome signaling in human macrophages, indicating enhanced inflammatory potential. However, production of the streptococcal cysteine protease SpeB was unaffected by this mutation. These findings provide new insights into the virulence strategies of invasive M1UK isolates.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nAdditional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a subset of Australian M1\n\nIn a previous large-scale genomic analysis of Australian invasive GAS M1 isolates, 10 M1UK isolates were found to possess between 8 and 17 SNPs in addition to the 27 lineage-defining SNPs () (, ). Among these mutations, seven SNPs were synonymous, and two SNPs were located in intergenic regions. A further two SNPs created preliminary stop codons in purC, which is involved in purine biosynthesis (), and H7X56_07280, which encodes a phage-related DNA primase. The remaining six SNPs caused non-synonymous changes in the transcriptional regulators RofA (RofAIle279Thr) and RocA (RocAAsp397Gly), the sensor kinase CovS (CovSAla318Val), as well as in three uncharacterized genes. Of note, the RofAIle279Thr mutation is distinct from the three RofA mutations already present in M1UK, which were previously shown not to have a conserved, phenotypic impact ().\n\nOverview of additional SNPs found in a subset of Australian M1UK isolates\n\nSNPs are identified by their nucleotide positions in comparison with the SP1380 (M1UK) reference genome (National Center for Biotechnology Information accession number CP060269.1). X indicates that the SNP is present in the listed isolate. \u2013 indicates the absence of an amino acid change due to the intergenic location of the SNP.\n\nGiven that RofA, RocA, and CovS have known functions in the transcriptional regulation of GAS virulence factor gene expression (, ), we investigated whether one or more of the additional mutations found in the Australian M1UK isolates alter the GAS virulence profile, using SP1450 and SP1466 as two representative isolates.\n\n\nA novel SNP in\n\nFirst, we compared protein expression levels of two major GAS virulence factors, SLO and SpeB, in the Australian M1UK isolates SP1450 and SP1466, which both harbor the additional SNPs in rofA, covS, and rocA, to representative GAS strains of the pre-1988 M1 genotype (SF370) (), the post-1988 M1global genotype (5448) (), and the contemporary M1UK genotype (SP1380) (). SLO protein abundance in culture supernatants of SP1450 and SP1466 was significantly increased (~6-fold) compared to the other M1 GAS strains (), while SpeB levels remained unchanged (; ), despite the presence of the CovSAla318Val mutation in SP1450 and SP1466.\n\nProtein expression of SLO and SpeB in M1 GAS strains and SP1450 isogenic mutants. All strains were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with 1% yeast extract to the late exponential growth phase (optical density at 600 nm = 0.8). Supernatant protein was purified using trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Expression of SLO and SpeB was visualized via immunoblotting. (A) Representative Western blot of n = 3 biological repeats; upper panel shows SLO; lower panel shows SpeB. Gaps between lanes indicate that additional samples have been cropped out of the full blot image (see ). (B) Quantification of SLO expression of n = 3 immunoblots, which was performed using ImageJ. Error bars represent SEM. Significance was analyzed by Tukey one-way analysis of variance. ****P < 0.0001. ns, not significant.\n\nTo identify which of the mutations in CovS, RofA, and RocA is responsible for the increased SLO expression in SP1450 and SP1466, we generated a set of isogenic mutants in SP1450, where the SNPs in the respective genes were individually corrected to reflect the M1global genotype (SP1450covS*, SP1450rofA*, and SP1450rocA*). SLO protein levels remained significantly increased in SP1450rofA* and SP1450rocA*, while correction of the covS SNP significantly reduced SLO production in SP1450covS* to a level comparable to that of the M1, M1global, and M1UK reference strains ().\n\nTo validate this finding, we introduced the covS SNP, resulting in the CovSAla318Val mutation into the M1global and M1UK genetic backgrounds to create 5448CovS:Ala318Val and SP1380CovS:Ala318Val, respectively, and analyzed RNA transcript levels of slo and speB in both isogenic mutants, as well as in SP1450 and SP1450covS* (). A significant increase (~8.5-fold) in slo transcripts was detected in 5448CovS:Ala318Val and SP1380CovS:Ala318Val compared to the respective parental strains. By contrast, repair of the CovSAla318Val mutation in SP1450 (SP1450covS*) reduced slo transcription levels (not statistically significant). No changes in speB transcript levels were detected in any of the mutant strains (), confirming previous observations. The parallel measurement of protein abundances revealed that SLO production was increased approximately 5-fold in 5448CovS:Ala318Val and SP1380CovS:Ala318Val, similar to the levels produced by SP1450 (). Conversely, SLO levels in SP1450covS* were significantly reduced and comparable to the amounts secreted by the other M1 strains. This differential expression pattern of SLO was not affected by the presence of LL-37 (data not shown), indicating that the observed effects of CovSAla318Val likely have physiological relevance. In addition, neither the presence nor the absence of CovSAla318Val affected SpeB protein levels (; ). Similar growth behavior of all strains confirmed that the observed effects of CovSAla318Val were not due to growth differences between isolates and mutants (). Taken together, these results suggest that the CovSAla318Val mutation detected in a subset of Australian M1UK isolates drives increased SLO expression.\n\nCovSAla318Val increases slo expression in M1 GAS. To account for possible RNA degradation at later growth stages, strains were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with 1% yeast liquid culture to the mid-exponential growth phase (optical density at 600 nm = 0.4). Quantified RNA transcripts of slo (A) and speB (B), relative to the gyrA gene, were normalized to 5448. Precipitated preparations of total culture supernatant protein were probed for SLO and SpeB by immunoblotting. (C) Representative Western blot of n = 3 biological repeats; upper panel shows SLO, and lower panel shows SpeB. (D) SLO protein expression in n = 3 replicates was quantified with ImageJ. All error bars represent SEM. Significance was analyzed by unpaired Welch t-test comparing wild-type strains and respective isogenic mutants. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.\n\nNumerous mutations in covS have been reported in the literature, but only a few have been functionally characterized (, , , ). To determine the novelty of the covSC953T SNP (resulting in CovSAla318Val), a tBLASTn search was performed against 109,874,994 nucleotide sequences submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information nucleotide database (accessed on 23 October 2024 with the search filter \u201cStreptococcus pyogenes [taxid1314]\u201d). Using sequences spanning a region of 15 amino acids up- and downstream of position 318 in CovS, the search identified no non-synonymous covS mutations that would result in the Ala318Val substitution. In addition, a direct protein BLAST search also did not yield any matching amino acid sequence in isolates other than those described in this study, suggesting that this mutation has not been previously identified.\n\n\nImpact of the CovS\n\nThe role of the CovRS two-component system in gene regulation and virulence of GAS is well established (, , , , ). To investigate the impact of the novel CovSAla318Val mutation on global gene expression, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of the strain pairs 5448/5448CovS:Ala318Val and SP1380/SP1380CovS:Ala318Val, grown to the mid-exponential growth phase in vitro.\n\nOverall, the presence of CovSAla318Val had a very limited effect on the known CovRS regulon () (). In total, eight genes were commonly differentially regulated in the mutant strains compared to their respective wild-type strains (; ). As expected, slo expression was significantly upregulated in 5448CovS:Ala318Val (fold change = 6.7) and SP1380CovS:Ala318Val (fold change = 5.7). Our analysis revealed that this upregulation encompassed the entire slo operon, which includes slo and the genes encoding NADase (nga) and the NADase inhibitor (ifs). In addition, the genes encoding the known GAS virulence factors SIC (), Ska (), and SpyA (), as well as the endonuclease Cas1c, were all upregulated in the presence of CovSAla318Val.\n\nRNA sequencing analysis investigating the impact of CovSAla318Val on global gene transcription in 5448 and SP1380. (A and B) Volcano plots highlighting upregulated genes in red and downregulated genes in blue (P \u2009<\u2009 0.05, \u22651 log2 fold change; n \u2009=\u2009 3). (C) Venn-diagram showing overlapping and individual genes that are differentially expressed in both comparison pairs (upregulated in red, downregulated in blue).\n\nDifferentially regulated genes in 5448CovS:Ala318Val versus 5448,\n\nStatistically significant values (P < 0.05) highlighted in gray.\n\nCPM, counts per million; FC, fold change.\n\nDifferentially regulated genes in SP1380CovS:Ala318Val versus SP1380,\n\nStatistically significant values (P < 0.05) highlighted in gray.\n\nCPM, counts per million; FC, fold change.\n\nOnly 21 genes were differentially expressed in 5448CovS:Ala318Val (), and 13 genes were differentially expressed in SP1380CovS:Ala318Val () compared to their respective parental strains. Genes that were significantly upregulated in 5448CovS:Ala318Val compared to 5448 included several virulence factors known to be regulated by CovRS, including sda1 (Sda1) (), scpC (SpyCEP) (), arcA (ADI) () and streptococcal collagen\u2010like protein 1 (scl-1) (), and several genes of the cas operon (CRISPR-associated proteins). In SP1380CovS:Ala318Val, scpA/B (C5a peptidase) (), fbaA (fibronectin-binding protein of group A streptococci) (), and sda3 (encoding a putative DNase) were significantly upregulated compared to SP1380. Although not statistically significant, upregulated sda1, scpC and scl-1 expression was also observed in SP1380CovS:Ala318Val, indicating a similar trend compared to 5448CovS:Ala318Val. In contrast, only a small number of genes were downregulated in the presence of CovSAla318Val, including a putative serine hydrolase encoded by SP5448_RS03730 and H7X56_05725 in 5448CovS:Ala318Val and SP1380CovS:Ala318Val, respectively. The gene encoding the G-related alpha2M-binding protein (grab) () was downregulated in both 5448CovS:Ala318Val and SP1380CovS:Ala318Val, though the change in SP1380CovS:Ala318Val was not statistically significant.\n\nIn summary, introduction of CovSAla318Val into 5448 and SP1380 altered the known CovRS regulon by upregulating expression of a limited number of CovRS-regulated virulence genes, including the nga-ifs-slo operon, ska and sic, without affecting expression of other virulence factors known to be regulated by CovRS, such as speB or hasA ().\n\n\nSP1450 triggers enhanced IL-1\u03b2 secretion in THP-1 macrophages\n\nThe secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, plays a critical role during invasive GAS disease progression (, ), and it has been shown that covRS-mutated M1global GAS triggers enhanced IL-1\u03b2 production in human neutrophils (). We and others have previously reported that SLO is the major driver of inflammasome-dependent IL-1\u03b2 secretion in human macrophages (). To test if the CovSAla318Val mutation, which results in increased SLO expression, might induce amplified inflammasome activation, human macrophage-like THP-1 cells were infected with SF370 (M1), 5448 (M1global), SP1380 (M1UK), and SP1450 (see ) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25. At each timepoint, samples of the cell supernatants were taken to determine IL-1\u03b2 levels in cell culture supernatants (). As a positive control, cells were treated with 5 \u00b5M nigericin, an ionophore and established NLRP3 inflammasome activator (). Since inflammasome activity can induce pyroptosis, we also assessed the levels of cytotoxicity by measuring the release of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; ). While neither IL-1\u03b2 nor LDH release was detected in cell culture supernatants at 30 min post-infection, IL-1\u03b2 and LDH levels steadily increased in all samples with longer infection times and to varying degrees. All tested M1 strains induced higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 than the nigericin control 60 min post-infection, with the exception of SF370. In contrast, only a minor increase of LDH release was detected at this timepoint, suggesting that inflammasome activation had not yet resulted in pyroptotic cell death. After 90 min of infection, the levels of secreted IL-1\u03b2 in cells infected with SP1450 reached 91.7% of the respective nigericin control, which was significantly higher than samples infected with SF370 (34.6%) and SP1380 (65.1%), and markedly higher than 5448-infected samples (71.3%). At 120 min post-infection, levels of IL-1\u03b2 were significantly higher in cells infected with SP1450 compared to SP1380 (82.7% and 62.7% of the nigericin control, respectively). No significant difference in IL-1\u03b2 secretion was observed between 5448 and SP1380 at these timepoints, indicating that the M1UK lineage-defining SNPs do not affect inflammasome activation under these conditions. Although the levels of LDH released by cells infected with SP1450 reached up to 58.4% of the total lysis control after 120 min, no significant difference between strains could be observed during the infection time course.\n\nSP1450 triggers enhanced IL-1\u03b2 secretion from differentiated THP-1 macrophages. Cells were infected with M1 GAS strains at MOI = 25. Nigericin, a potent bacterial ionophore, was used as a positive control for inflammasome activation. At the indicated timepoints, assay supernatants were collected and analyzed for (A) IL-1\u03b2 and (B) LDH release. Data are presented as the mean percentage of the 2 h nigericin control for IL-1\u03b2 release (A) or as mean percentage of complete cell lysis induced by Triton X-100 for LDH release (B) \u00b1 SEM of n = 3 independent replicate experiments. Significance was calculated using Brown-Forsythe and Welch analysis of variance tests. *P < 0.05.\n\nTaken together, these results show that the additional SNPs present in SP1450, including CovSAla318Val, contribute to enhanced inflammasome-dependent inflammation elicited during GAS infection.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nRecent outbreaks of scarlet fever and an increase in invasive GAS infections in various regions worldwide (, , , ) have been attributed to several factors, including a dampened immunity to GAS following coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions () and the emergence of new virulent clones, notably M1UK (, ). Over the past decade, M1UK has spread rapidly and has become the dominant M1 lineage in several countries, including the UK, the Netherlands, and Australia (, , , ).\n\nDifferential gene expression and in vivo virulence of GAS are modulated by regulatory systems, including the CovRS two-component regulatory system that acts primarily through gene repression () and enables GAS to respond to environmental changes (). In invasive infections caused by M1global GAS, spontaneously occurring mutations in covS can enhance the pathogen\u2019s virulence and drive disease progression (, , ). The \u201cclassic\u201d CovRS regulon was identified through studies of mutants in which CovS kinase activity had been completely inactivated (), a state than can result from larger deletions and frameshift mutations.\n\ncovRS mutants have been observed in the M1UK lineage () but have not been fully characterized. In this study, we identified a novel mutation in the covS gene in three invasive Australian M1UK isolates and investigated its impact on GAS virulence gene expression. Our findings revealed that the CovSAla318Val mutation increased expression of a subset of virulence genes typically upregulated in CovS-inactive mutants, such as slo, ska, and spyA, but, unexpectedly, not others including speA, hasA (, ), or pepO, the latter of which has been identified as a marker for CovRS defects (). In addition, CovSAla318Val did not affect speB expression, which is often lost in CovS-inactive mutants (, , ). Together, these observations suggest that the CovSAla318Val amino acid substitution does not completely inactivate CovS function but rather modulates its activity. Residue Ala318 is located in the HisKA domain of CovS (). An early study reported that alanine has a significantly higher helical propensity than valine, and alanine-to-valine substitutions can affect protein function, particularly when they occur in the middle of an \u03b1-helix (), as is the case for CovSAla318Val ().\n\nIt was previously demonstrated that SpeB contributes to GAS colonization by impairing autophagy in epithelial cells, thereby facilitating intracellular GAS replication (), and degrading proteins essential for the integrity of intercellular junctions (, ). In addition, SpeB also promotes GAS survival in subcutaneous () and intranasal () infection models. The limited impact of CovSAla318Val on speB expression suggests that M1UK isolates with this mutation may retain their ability to colonize and persist in non-invasive settings. Moreover, the identification of the CovSAla318Val mutation in three separate invasive isolates could indicate that not all of the gene expression changes observed in CovS-inactive mutants are required to confer a fitness advantage during invasive infection. Instead, a mutation that partially preserves CovS function and thus CovR phosphorylation could have a similar impact. A recent study investigating CovR binding sites noted that while varying phosphorylation levels of CovR can impact its promotor binding affinity, there is no linear relationship between CovR occupancy and transcript-level changes (). This suggests that, in addition to CovS, other co-factors may be required to regulate genes targeted by CovR. Indeed, the existence of intermediate regulators of the CovRS regulon has been reported (); however, the mechanisms underlying this indirect regulation remain to be characterized. Continued longitudinal surveillance and comprehensive analyses of clinical CovRS-mutated isolates are warranted to fully elucidate the impact of covRS point mutations on GAS virulence and persistence.\n\nNasopharyngeal GAS colonization has been shown to be promoted by IL-1\u03b2 signaling (). As a potential explanation for this observation, it was suggested that GAS can survive the consequences of IL-1\u03b2 signaling, particularly neutrophil activation, whereas commensal bacteria do not, allowing GAS to colonize their niche (). In addition, covRS-mutated GAS has an increased ability to evade neutrophil clearance during invasive infection (, ). GAS-induced IL-1\u03b2 signaling has previously been examined in the THP-1 model of human macrophages (). Our earlier research demonstrated that the streptolysins SLO and SLS are primary activators of IL-1\u03b2 production in this model (). Here, we observed that the Australian M1UK isolate SP1450, which carries the CovSAla318Val mutation and overexpresses SLO, triggers enhanced IL-1\u03b2 secretion from human THP-1 macrophages compared to other invasive M1 strains. While this result suggests that CovSAla318Val, responsible for increased SLO expression in SP1450, is the primary cause of the amplified IL-1\u03b2-dependent inflammation, the overall contribution of inflammasome signaling to M1UK virulence remains to be determined.\n\nIn conclusion, this study characterizes a novel covS mutation detected in a subset of invasive Australian M1UK isolates that alters the established CovRS regulon and potentially offers a fitness advantage during human infection, thereby providing new insights into the fine-tuning of CovS function and virulence strategies in M1UK.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nBacterial strains and culturing conditions\n\nAll wild-type bacterial strains and isolates used in this study are listed in . The complete genome sequences of SP1380 (accession number CP060269) and SP1450 (accession number CP060266.1) were previously determined by Oxford Nanopore sequencing (). All GAS strains were routinely streak-purified from cryo-stocks and grown on 5% horse blood agar (bioM\u00e9rieux, Australia) at 37\u00b0C. Liquid cultures of GAS were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (BD, USA) supplemented with 1% yeast (THY; Merck, USA) or in a chemically defined medium () to the indicated optical density at 600 \u2009nm (OD600). The Escherichia coli strain MC1061, which was used for site-directed mutagenesis, was grown in Luria-Bertani medium. For plasmid selection and maintenance, 100 \u00b5g/mL spectinomycin was added to both GAS and E. coli cultures.\n\nBacterial strains and isolates used in this study\n\n\nGAS mutant construction\n\nAll isogenic mutants created in this study are listed in . Isogenic mutants of 5448, SP1380, and SP1450 were generated using a previously published protocol for creating markerless isogenic GAS mutants (). PCR primers were designed to replace the covS, rofA, and rocA genes in SP1450 with the respective genes from 5448 (M1global) and to introduce the covS gene from SP1450 (including the covSC953T SNP, which results in the CovSAla318Val mutation) into 5448 and SP1380. All PCR primer sequences used for the creation of isogenic GAS mutants are provided in . Successful gene replacements were confirmed via PCR and DNA sequencing (Genetic Research Services, University of Queensland, Australia) using the primers specified in .\n\nIsogenic GAS mutants used in this study\n\n\nPrecipitation of bacterial supernatant proteins and immunoblotting\n\nTotal protein from bacterial culture supernatants was isolated as previously described (). Briefly, supernatants of GAS cultures grown in THY were strained through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter (Merck; SLGP033RS) and combined with concentrated trichloroacetic acid (10% of the final volume, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Total supernatant protein was precipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C, harvested by centrifugation and washed in ice-cold pure ethanol. Dried protein pellets were resuspended in a loading buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich, D0632) and boiled for 15 min with occasional vortexing. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE before being transferred onto methanol-activated Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Merck, IPFL00010) using a standard wet transfer system (Bio-Rad, USA). Membranes were blocked in Intercept Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, 927-70003) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies targeting SLO () and SpeB (Toxin Technology, USA; PBI222) at a 1:1,000 dilution. Membranes were incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies (DyLight 800 anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (H + L); New England Biolabs, USA; used at 1:10,000 dilution) for 60 min at room temperature before proteins were detected by scanning the membranes with an Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).\n\n\nRNA isolation\n\nGAS cell pellets from THY liquid cultures grown to the mid-exponential growth phase (OD600 = 0.4) were resuspended in 700 \u00b5L RLT buffer (Qiagen, Germany) supplemented with 1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad). Samples were transferred into lysing matrix B tubes (MP Biomedicals, USA) and lysed using a FastPrep homogenizer (MP Biomedicals) for 2\u00d7 cycles of 30 s at a speed of 9 m/s and with a 3-min pause between cycles. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 \u00d7 g for 1 min. RNA was immediately extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Qiagen), which included an on-column digestion with DNase I (Qiagen) to remove excess DNA from the samples. Final RNA was diluted in nuclease-free water, and concentrations were determined with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Following the extraction, a total amount of 5 \u00b5g RNA was used for an additional, off-column DNA digestion using the TurboDNase kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All samples were confirmed DNA-free by KAPA HiFi PCR (Roche, Switzerland). High RNA integrity (RIN > 7) was confirmed using the TapeStation platform (Agilent Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis, USA).\n\n\nReal-time PCR\n\nFor real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assays, 500 ng RNA was transcribed into cDNA using the GoScript Reverse Transcriptase kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Promega, USA). Diluted cDNA was amplified using the QuantiNova SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). All primers used for RT-PCR are listed in . The relative expression of target genes was determined using standard \u201cfast reaction\u201d parameters on the QuantStudio6 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific); an initial denaturation cycle (95\u00b0C for 5 min) was followed by 45 cycles of amplification (95\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 10 s, and 72\u00b0C for 10 s). Following the PCR, melting curves were generated to confirm that only a single reaction product was amplified for each primer pair (data not shown). Relative mRNA transcript levels of the target genes were determined using the \u0394\u0394Ct method () and normalized to reference gene gyrA ().\n\n\nRNA sequencing analysis\n\nRibosome depletion, Illumina library prep, and single-end RNA sequencing with NovaSeq was undertaken by The Australian Genome Research Facility (Melbourne, Australia). Raw sequence data were analyzed with tools available on Galaxy Australia (). Default parameters were used for all tools unless stated otherwise. For quality control, sequence data were checked with FastQC (Galaxy, version 0.73) (). Sequence reads were then mapped to the respective reference genomes using the Bowtie2 tool (Galaxy, version 2.5.0) with the parameter \u201cvery sensitive local\u201d (). Reads that map to multiple locations were filtered, and the number of mapped reads per gene was calculated with featureCounts (version 1.6.4) (), with the minimum overlap length set to 20 bp. Differential gene expression analysis in the comparison pairs 5448/5448CovS:Ala318Val and SP1380/SP1380CovS:Ala318Val was performed using limma-voom (Galaxy, version 3.50.1) (, ). Weights were applied to outliers to decrease the weight of variable samples. Genes with a count per million of <1 in less than four samples per comparison pair were not included. Genes were normalized using the trimmed mean of M values method. Genes with a log2 fold change value of \u22651 and \u2264\u22121 and an adjusted P value of \u22640.05 were considered significant (). Data were visualized with Glimma (version 1.10.0) (). Multidimensional scaling analysis visualizing replicate clustering is provided in .\n\n\nInfection dose preparation for\n\nFor preparation of infection doses used for in vitro macrophage assays, liquid bacterial cultures were grown statically in a chemically defined medium () to the mid-logarithmic growth phase at OD600 = 0.3. The cultures were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 8,000 \u00d7 g and washed in Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Bacterial cell pellets were then resuspended and diluted in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (Bovogen, Australia) to the indicated MOI.\n\n\nCulture and differentiation of THP-1 cells\n\nHuman THP-1 monocytic cells expressing Cas9 () were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Bovogen), 10 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The THP-1 cells were differentiated into a macrophage-like phenotype using phorbol myristate acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described ().\n\n\nMacrophage infection assay\n\nDifferentiated THP-1 cells were primed for inflammasome activation with lipopolysaccharide as previously described (). Following priming, the cell medium was removed and replaced with the indicated treatments or GAS infection dose diluted in assay medium. Cells treated with assay medium only served as a negative control, while the NLRP3 inflammasome-activating ionophore nigericin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a positive control. Cell culture plates were centrifuged for 10 min at 500 \u00d7 g to bring bacteria into contact with the cells, before being placed back into the incubator for the indicated time periods. Following the assay, plates were centrifuged for 5 min at 300 \u00d7 g to settle debris. Finally, assay supernatants were collected and probed for the secretion of LDH and IL-1\u03b2 as previously described ().\n\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAll statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism (versions 9 and 10). Data shown were collected from at least three independent experiments and are represented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean unless indicated otherwise. Significance was calculated using either ordinary or Brown-Forsythe and Welch one-way analysis of variance in combination with Dunnett or Tukey multiple comparisons post hoc tests, or Welch t-tests, as indicated.

Introduction\n\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common malignant tumor in South China and Southeast Asia. The incidence of NPC is influenced by various factors, such as virus infection and environmental factors [, ]. Genetic susceptibility or predisposition is also considered a potential contributor to NPC development [, ]. As we know, the differences in susceptibility to certain diseases and drug responses of different populations and individuals are often determined by allelic polymorphisms of the related genes, mainly in the form of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, SNPs located in coding, flanking, and regulatory regions may change gene function [].\n\nThe PLUNC gene has emerged as a novel candidate for an antitumor gene [], showing promising tissue-specific associations with NPC [, ]. Our previous study found that the two polymorphic loci C-2128T and C-1888T of PLUNC gene were closely related to the susceptibility of NPC in the Chinese population (OR\u2009=\u20092.8\u20133.3, p < 0.001). And the haplotype classification on this basis also showed that individuals with haplotype C-C were more likely to develop NPC (OR\u2009=\u20091.86, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.34\u20132.56, p=0.00016) [].\n\nWang analyzed the \u22125000\u2009\u223c\u2009+1000\u2009bp sequence at the 5\u2032 end of PLUNC gene using the bioinformatics tool to predict that the promoter exists in the region from \u2212490\u2009bp to +89\u2009bp. Based on these findings, it was confirmed that \u2212240\u223c +100\u2009bp in the flanking region at the 5\u2032 end of PLUNC gene had promoter activity through PCR amplification, luciferase vector construction, and identification [, ]. Precisely, the C-1888T polymorphism site is located in this region. The initial experiment demonstrated that the PLUNC gene promoter region SNP 1888TT genotype was capable of binding to nuclear proteins in human NPC CEN2 cells, whereas the CC genotype did not exhibit this binding capability []. Therefore, it is speculated that this polymorphic site affects the transcriptional regulation and function of the PLUNC gene, resulting in an increased susceptibility/risk of NPC. In this study, three types of these polymorphic loci were screened from the established NPC cells, and the mRNA expression levels of PLUNC gene in different genotypes were detected. At the same time, the transcriptional regulatory factors related to the polymorphic site C-1888T in the promoter region of PLUNC gene were preliminarily identified, which laid a foundation for further study on the regulation mechanism of PLUNC gene.\n\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n\n2.1. Materials\n\nNPC cell lines 5\u20138F, 6\u201310B, CNE1, CNE2, and C666-1 were conventionally preserved in our laboratory, and cell line SUNE1 was provided by the Cancer Institute of Southern Medical University. The Cell Genome DNA Extraction Kit was purchased from Tiangen Biotech. Ex Tag enzyme, FbaI enzyme, Total RNA Extractant RNAiso Plus, Reverse Transcription Kit, and SYBRPremix Ex TagTM II (Perfect Real Time) Kit were purchased from Ta KaRa Co., Ltd.

The PCR instrument is a product of Eppendorf Company in Germany. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay model is BioTek ELx800. The probe synthesis and sequencing were completed by Shanghai Invitrogen Biotechnology Co., LTD.\n\n\n2.2. Screening Three Genotypes of C-1888T Polymorphic Loci\n\nDNA of NPC cells was extracted, and the full length 192\u2009bp DNA sequence of the upstream promoter region of PLUNC gene was amplified by PCR-RFLP method. The PCR primer design, reaction system, and conditional were referenced []. 5\u2009\u03bcL PCR product was digested by enzyme, and the reaction system and conditions were referenced []. PCR and enzyme-cutting products were analyzed with 3% agarose gel electrophoresis. The interpretation of results is as follows: after digestion, only 192\u2009bp band was CC type, 170\u2009bp and 22\u2009bp bands were TT type, and all three bands were heterozygous CT type. At the same time, part of the PCR products were extracted and sequenced directly to verify the accuracy of enzyme digestion results.\n\n\n2.3. Detect the Expression of PLUNC in Different Cell Lines Through Quantitative Real-Time PCR (QPCR)\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from NPC cell lines by RNAiso Plus, precipitated by isopropyl alcohol, and quantified by spectrophotometer. The extracted total RNA was reversely transcribed into cDNA, and real-time QPCR amplification was performed by fluorescence QPCR instrument MX3005P using \u03b2-actin as an internal reference. All samples were converted to cDNA from RNA at the same concentration, and QPCR analysis was performed using cDNA at the same concentration. Two duplicate holes were made for each sample. The primers' sequences are as follows: PLUNC: the upstream primers are 5\u2032-TTGAGTCCCACAGGTCTTGCAG-3\u2032, the downstream primers are 5\u2032-CTCCAGGCTTCAGGATGTCCA-3\u2032. \u03b2-actin: the upstream primers are 5\u2032-TGGCACCCAGCACAATGAA-3\u2032, and the downstream primers are 5\u2032-CTAAGTCATAGTCCGCCTAGAAGCA-3\u2032. The reaction conditions of QPCR were 95\u00b0C. 30\u2009s, 1 cycle; 95\u00b0C, 5\u2009s; 60\u00b0C, 20\u2009s, 40 cycle. The Ct value was calculated automatically after the reaction, and \u25b3Ct (\u25b3Ct\u2009=\u2009target gene and Ct\u2009=\u2009internal reference Ct was used to indicate the relative expression level of the PLUNC gene in different cell lines.\n\n\n2.4. Bioinformatics Prediction and Probe Design\n\np-match (https://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/programs.html # pmatch) and Consite (https://mordor.cgb.ki.se/cgi-bin/CONSITE/consite/) were used for analysis and screened the transcription factors that are more likely to bind to C-1888T when the SNP is A or G, respectively. The binding core sequences of different transcription factors were obtained based on the binding site matrix information provided by TRANSFAC database. And the design method and principle of probe and mutant probe are referenced [].\n\n\n2.5. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)\n\nNucleoproteins were extracted from CC and TT type cells at logarithmic growth stage referenced []. The protein concentration was measured by BCA method, and the oligonucleotide probes were labeled by biotin according to kit instructions. The nucleoproteins were bound to biotin-labeled probes (conventional response group), while a negative control group without nucleoprotein, a specific competition inhibition group with 200 times excessive cold probe, and a nonspecific competition inhibition group with 100 times excessive mutant probe were set at the same time. The DNA\u2013nucleoprotein mixtures mentioned above were incubated at room temperature for 20\u2009min and then added to 6% polyacrylamide gel pre-electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the samples were transferred to a positively charged nylon film (380\u2009mA, 40\u2009min) and purple diplomatic strips. At last, the samples were exposed to x-ray film in a black box by detecting with a chemiluminescence nucleic acid detection kit.\n\n\n2.6. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)\n\nCC type NPC cells were cultured to 80%\u2009\u223c\u200990% fusion, and then, the culture medium was dumped. Cross-linking, lytic, and micrococcal nuclease digestion were performed according to the kit instructions, and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation, which contained the digested chromatin. 5\u2009\u03bcL chromatin supernatant was taken as input and stored at \u221220\u00b0C for later use. The rest of the chromatin reacts with antibodies after 10-fold dilution. Different controls were set as follows: (1) the positive control: 500\u2009\u03bcL diluted chromatin reacts with 10\u2009\u03bcL anti-RNA polymerase II antibody; (2) the negative control: 500\u2009\u03bcL diluted chromatin reacts with 1\u2009\u03bcL normal rabbit IgG; (3) the sample reaction group: 500\u2009\u03bcL diluted chromatin reacts with 1\u2009\u03bcL rabbit antihuman EVI1 polyclonal antibody. The antibody\u2013protein\u2013DNA complex was precipitated with protein A/G, and DNA elution, decross-linking, and purification were performed after washing. Then, anti-RNA polymerase II ChIP DNA, IgG ChIP DNA, EVI1 antibody ChIP DNA, and input DNA were used as templates for PCR amplification, and the amplification system was 25\u2009\u03bcL, the forward primer: 5\u2032-AGGTGAGACAGTTAAGCTATTTGAT-3\u2032, the reverse primer: 5\u2032-AGGGGCCAAGAGATGAGACT-3\u2032. The product was detected by 2% gel electrophoresis and then sequenced.\n\n\n2.7. Statistical Analysis\n\nSPSS 25.0 was used for analysis. The measurement data were expressed by means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation, and the comparison of multiple means was performed by one-way ANOVA. p < 0.05 was considered significant.\n\n\n3. Results\n\n\n3.1. Screening for Three Genotypes of SNP Site\n\nNPC cell lines 5\u20138F, 6\u201310B, CNE1, and CNE2 were heterozygous CT type, SUNE1 was homozygous CC type, and C666-1 was homozygous TT type (the 22\u2009bp band was gelated due to its small size). The direct sequencing results of PCR products were identical with those of PCR-RFLP interpretation analysis ().\n\n\n3.2. mRNA Expression of PLUNC Gene in Different Cell Lines\n\nThere were always sample wells failed to measure the value of Ct in the CNE1 cell line through repeated measurements, so the relevant statistical analysis was been abandoned. The relative expression amount \u25b3Ct value of PLUNC gene in different cell lines is shown in , and homogeneity of variance was tested by Levene (F\u2009=\u20092.395, p=0.120). The PLUNC gene expression of each cell line was significantly different. In addition, LSD multiple comparisons revealed significant differences in gene expression between CC and TT type cell lines (p < 0.001).\n\n\n3.3. Bioinformatics Prediction and Probe Design and Synthesis\n\nWhen the C-1888T site was G\u2009>\u2009A, different new transcription factor binding sites would be formed, and three candidate transcription factors --XFD3, EVI1, and CREL might bind to this site. Whether the site was A or G, CREL occurred in the same binding. However, XFD3 and EVI1 had a high probability of binding when the SNP locus was A and G, respectively (score was 0.96 and 1.00, respectively) ().\n\nAccording to the binding site matrix information provided by TRANSFAC database, the binding core sequences of XFD3 and EVI1 were TTGGTCAACAAGAT and CGACAAGATAA, respectively (). The letter represented the binding site base sequence, and the numerical value after the letter represented the binding activity of each base. Based on the matrix information of each transcription factor, the mutant probe was designed using the substitution mutation method, which meant that the base with the highest binding activity was replaced with a base with low or no binding activity. The selection of each base was based on not producing new transcription factor binding sites. The detailed sequences are shown in .\n\n\n3.4. EMSA\n\nWhen SNP C-1888T of PLUNC gene was A and G, respectively, the probe could bind to different transcription factors to form block bands and could be inhibited by specific competition. In contrast, the mutant probe could not inhibit the binding reaction ().\n\n\n3.5. ChIP Analysis\n\nA 192\u2009bp fragment of PLUNC gene promoter region containing the binding site of transcription factor EVI1 was amplified by PCR using DNA extracted from chromatin fragments immunoprecipitated by EVI1 antibody as the template. The results showed that a band appeared at 192\u2009bp after anti-RNA polymerase II ChIP DNA, EVI1 antibody ChIP DNA, and input DNA amplification, while no bands appeared after the negative control IgG ChIP DNA amplification (). That indicated the PLUNC gene promoter region has the binding site of EVI1.\n\n\n4. Discussion and Conclusion\n\n\n4.1. Discussion\n\nThe pathogenesis of NPC is a multistage, multipathway, and multimechanism process. No recognized specific oncogene of NPC was found except only some closely related genes. PLUNC gene, the candidate tumor suppressor gene, was first cloned in human nasopharyngeal tissue by Yao Kaitai's research group []. The expression of PLUNC gene showed relative tissue specificity. In situ hybridization results indicated that it was mainly expressed in the pseudolaminated ciliated columnar epithelium of the nasopharynx, trachea, and bronchus, and the gene expression gradually decreased along the respiratory tract from top to bottom []. And in the NPC biopsy tissues, the expression of PLUNC was decreased or not expressed []. However, the exact biological function of PLUNC gene is still unclear.\n\nOur previous study on the SNP PLUNC gene confirmed an association between polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene and susceptibility to NPC. Three genotypes were identified by base mismatch, enzyme digestion, and sequencing. To understand whether this locus's polymorphism affected gene expression level, mRNA expression level of different cell lines was detected by fluorescence QPCR and the relationship between mRNA level of different genotypes and the polymorphism of this locus was analyzed. The Ct value has a logarithmic linear relationship with the initial copy number of the reaction template. The smaller Ct value indicated the more initial copy number of the gene and the higher expression of the gene; otherwise, the lower expression of the gene. The results of our study showed that the Ct values were highly measured by all cell lines, and the Ct values in CNE1 even failed to measure several times, which meant that the expression level of PLUNC gene in NPC cell lines was low. Previous literature reported that the expression of PLUNC gene in NPC tissues was extremely low by suppressive subtractive hybridization [] or in situ hybridization. However, the PLUNC gene expression in cell mRNA level was verified this time, consistent with the previous results. The relative expression levels of PLUNC gene in different cell lines were significantly different (p \u2264 0.001). Further, multiple LSD comparisons showed that the expression levels of PLUNC gene in CC cell lines were significantly different from those in TT cell lines; the gene expression levels in CC cells were significantly lower than those in TT cell lines (p \u2264 0.001). Liu, He, and Wang [] constructed two promoter-reporter gene (luciferase) expression vectors and detected luciferase activity. It was found that the activity of the 1888\u2009C promoter was significantly lower than the basic promoter 1888\u2009T of PLUNC, with a significant decrease of about 64.67%, and the difference between the two was statistically significant. Combined with these results, we hypothesized that C-C individuals were more susceptible to NPC because the polymorphic site down-regulates PLUNC gene expression by affecting its transcriptional regulation.\n\nAs a kind of protein molecule with a special structure and functions of regulating gene expression, transcription factor plays an important role in the occurrence, development, and metastasis of tumors []. Bioinformatics software predicted that transcription factor EVI1 had a high possibility of binding when the polymorphism site of C-1888T was G. To confirm whether the transcription factor can bind to the DNA fragment of the promoter region of PLUNC gene, the corresponding probes and a series of competitive reactions were designed using EMSA method. Using DNA extracted from chromatin fragment immunoprecipitated by EVI1 antibody as a template, the PLUNC gene promoter fragment containing the binding site of transcription factor EVI1 was successfully amplified by PCR. These results indicated that the binding of transcription factor EVI1 to DNA was specific and participated in regulating the PLUNC gene.\n\nTranscription factor EVI1 is considered to be a proto-oncogene that plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis [], and abnormal EVI1 expression is often observed in hematological malignancies [] and some solid tumors [\u2013]. Recent studies have shown that EVI1 may be associated with the occurrence of NPC [], but there were few studies reported the biological role and potential mechanism of EVI1 in NPC. EVI1 contains two zinc finger protein domains, which can specifically recognize DNA []. Depending on its finger spatial structure, it extends into the groove of the DNA double helix and makes specific contact with DNA bases through the \u03b1 helix []. It plays a vital role in gene expression regulation, cell differentiation, embryo development, and other aspects. The first zinc finger protein domain contained in EVI1 can inhibit TGF-\u03b2 signaling [, ], and the latter is the most studied growth regulator, which can inhibit the proliferation of a variety of cell types and play a role in the occurrence and development of tumors. Lu et al. [] reported that EVI1 might inhibit E-cadherin expression through the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway and ultimately affect epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSs) characteristics of NPC cells, which is closely related to the occurrence, development, invasion, and metastasis of NPC. Therefore, how to increase the susceptibility of the body after binding EVI1 and PLUNC gene promoter region, what are the specific regulatory mechanisms, and what signal transduction pathways lead to the proliferation of tumor cells need to be further clarified.\n\nTranscription factor XFD3 has been identified in Xenopus laevis, now belonging to the Forkhead box (Fox) family []. Each member of the multigene family contains an evolutionarily conserved structure, the fork-head domain, which maintains the multifunction of embryonic stem cells, regulates apoptosis and cell cycle, regulates carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and regulates immune regulation. The mutation and abnormal expression of the multigene family are related to developmental malformation, metabolic diseases, and neoplasms. According to the nomenclature, XFD3 is now called FoxA2a, and the coding sequence of the fork-head domain is highly homologous to Foxa2 in rodents and Foxa2 in humans [, ]. Hnf-3 \u03b2 plays an important role in gastral differentiation, and ectopic HNF-3\u03b2 can inhibit endoderm formation []. It is known that the epithelium of the respiratory tract, the epithelium of the digestive tract, the liver, and the pancreas are formed by endoderm differentiation. At present, studies on HNF-3\u03b2/Foxa2/Foxa2 were mainly focused on gastric cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other gastrointestinal tumors [\u2013], lung cancer and other lung diseases [], and the relationship with nasopharyngeal tumors had not been reported. Nasopharyngeal epithelium and lung epithelium both belong to the respiratory epithelium. Some researchers established mouse lung models exposed to cigarette smoke and found that Foxa2 and E-cadherin expression were down-regulated in airway epithelium. MAPK and Foxa2 mediated the development of squamous metaplasia in the lung of smoking rats, while MAPK inhibitors up-regulated Foxa2, leading to a decreased degree of lung squamous metaplasia []. In addition to the fork-head domain, the overall homology of proteins between rodents and Xenopus is about 70%. Therefore, further study needs to study whether there are differences in the final encoded proteins and functions and whether the signaling pathways involved are similar to those mentioned above. Although the EMSA results suggested that XFD3 could bind to the DNA fragment of the PLUNC gene promoter region, there was no suitable commercial XFD3 antibody at present, so the ChIP test was not performed to verify the EMSA results further. At the same time, human blood samples may be needed for future studies.\n\nNPC demonstrates a familial aggregation phenomenon, with 10% of patients having a family history of tumors, suggesting that genetic susceptibility or predisposition may play a significant role in its pathogenesis. This study has shed light on some of the pathogenic factors of NPC through susceptibility research at polymorphic loci. However, it is crucial not to underestimate the impact of EB virus infection, environmental factors, chemical carcinogens, and carcinogens in the development of NPC. Moreover, the highest incidence of NPC was observed among the Chinese population, particularly the Cantonese, globally. With China being home to 56 ethnic groups, geographical, cultural, religious, social, political, or traditional factors may lead to distinct mutations due to isolation among different ethnicities, races, or groups. The study of gene transcription regulation is a complex network system, where in vitro and in vivo experiments may yield varying results, and differences in biological cell physiological states and environmental factors can influence experimental outcomes. Moving forward, our research will concentrate on refining and conducting in-depth analyses of various confounding factors. Increasing the sample size and encompassing multiple populations, ethnicities, and geographical regions will aid in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the polymorphisms and susceptibility of PLUNC gene and NPC, as well as the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.\n\n\n4.2. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the expression of the PLUNC gene, a tumor suppressor gene, was downregulated in NPC cell lines. This downregulation was more pronounced in CC type cell lines compared to TT type cell lines, indicating an elevated risk of NPC. We hypothesized that the C/T polymorphism at this locus led to differential binding of transcription factors, resulting in distinct transcriptional regulation processes that contributed to this risk. Through the utilization of bioinformatics tools for analysis, we validated the biological hypothesis using EMSA and ChIP assays to confirm the involvement of EVI1 in the transcriptional regulation of the PLUNC gene. This study sets the stage for further exploration of trans-acting factor regulatory mechanisms and biological functions of the PLUNC gene, with the ultimate aim of unraveling its functional mysteries and offering novel strategies for cancer prevention and treatment."}

CNVs, including deletions and duplications >1 kb, are key genetic variations linked to various complex diseases. Despite advances in next-generation sequencing, SNP arrays remain common due to cost and applicability. However, CNV analysis with these data requires integrating multiple complex tools and quality control steps, for which comprehensive, user-friendly pipelines are lacking.\n\nThe pipeline, implemented using the Snakemake workflow engine, consists of two modular sub-pipelines: (1) CNV calling and quality control (QC), and (2) rare CNV burden and gene-set enrichment analyses.

Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods exist, SNP arrays remain widely used due to their cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe pipeline is implemented using Snakemake and consists of two main sub-pipelines: (1) calling and quality control (QC), and (2) rare CNV analysis. The first sub-pipeline processes SNP array intensity data to detect CNVs and filters out low-quality samples based on parameters like LRR_SD and BAF_drift. It also removes CNVs in problematic regions such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and telomeres.

The pipeline primarily focuses on identifying CNVs smaller than 1 kb, which are often overlooked in other methods. It employs the latest qPCR and MLPA techniques rather than SNP arrays for data input. The authors report using PennCNV and Plink software exclusively for data visualization but did not integrate quality control steps in their workflow.\n\nThe study tested the pipeline on a small cohort of 100 samples genotyped with an Affymetrix array, analyzing over 700,000 markers. CNVs were filtered using a novel threshold of 10 probes and minimum length of 5 kb, contrary to the usual standards. Notably, the pipeline failed to remove calls overlapping the Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region or near centromeres and telomeres, which may introduce artifacts. Also, the frequency thresholds for rare CNVs were mistakenly set at 10% instead of the typical 1-2%.\n\nPerformance benchmarks indicated that the pipeline takes under one hour to complete both sub-pipelines, but no parallelization options were enabled, potentially limiting scalability. The case\u2013control analysis revealed no significant enrichment in deletions or duplications across any length categories, which contradicts prior findings.

In particular, distinct large (>\u20091000\u00a0kb) CNVs have been linked to rare disease phenotypes, and they may contribute to common polygenic diseases [].\n\nNumerous methods for the detection of CNVs have been established throughout the past decades. Initially, targeted gene panel methods such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were used. However, the introduction of the genome-wide approaches offered a significant advance in the CNV detection methods. Microarray-based methods such as array-CGH (comparative genomic hybridization) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-array allow the investigation of CNVs [, ], and more recently next-generation sequencing (NGS) [] data are being used for CNV detection.\n\nDespite the evolution of NGS-based methods, microarrays are still often the first tier solution for whole genome studies due to their comparatively lower cost and broad applicability. A large number of studies have investigated rare CNVs using microarray based genotyping data and yielded important insights [\u2013]. These investigations typically involve intricate procedures, necessitating multiple analyses, careful choice of software, calibration of sensitivity to parameters and their thresholds, and execution setting. Computational and scientific outcomes therefore hinge upon automation and thorough documentation of implementation specifics. Standardized basic protocols for calling CNVs and performing association tests have been proposed by others, such as in Lin et al. [], however a comprehensive simple-to-use bioinformatic implementation has not been provided.\n\nConducting a case\u2013control study based on rare CNVs involves several critical steps: (1) CNV detection, (2) quality control, (3) burden analysis, and (4) gene-set enrichment analysis. High-throughput genomic technologies, commonly employed in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), provide the signal intensity data necessary for CNV detection. Subsequently, tools like PennCNV [] and Plink [] are typically used for the case\u2013control analysis of CNV, focusing on individual-based CNV calls, and rare CNVs, respectively. Conducting such analyses therefore requires adeptly applying and coordinating multiple advanced bioinformatic software, but to the best of our knowledge a bioinformatic pipeline implementing rare CNV analysis in a structured, flexible, and scalable manner remains missing.\n\nIn this work, we present a generic bioinformatic solution for identifying rare CNVs in case\u2013control studies. Our main goal is to provide a flexible tool that enables users to conduct rare CNV analysis using SNP array data from different case\u2013control studies.\n\n\nImplementation\n\nWe have employed the Snakemake workflow [] engine to construct a robust pipeline consisting of two sub-pipelines: (1) calling and QC analysis and (2) rare CNV analysis (Fig.\u00a0). The code is modular and rule-based, using the modular configuration allowed by Snakemake (Fig.\u00a0). Notably, if input files are missing for any rule, Snakemake will report it and the execution will be stopped. Files generated previously in successfully executed rules will be preserved. The next execution will start from the last rule completed. Moreover, if an execution error occurs, any corrupted output file is automatically deleted to maintain consistency. The rule-based structure enables automation while maintaining flexibility: Both sub-pipelines can be modified according to the nature of the study through parameters, software, or the addition of custom code. To illustrate this feature, instructions on how to adapt the input file format in the calling and QC sub-pipeline are described in the Pipeline Guide available in our RareCNVsAnalysis GitHub repository [] under the section Input Files Specification. In addition, configuration files (such as variables.py and dependenciesenv.yml) are provided to facilitate the modification of the default value of parameters and the inclusion of new software (or a different version)(see Pipeline Guide\u00a0Fig.\u00a03 and Pipeline Guide\u00a0Fig.\u00a04 in the\u00a0GitHub repository). Also, code that is executed in many rules can be added in the external functions.sh file to enhance the pipeline\u00b4s modularity, clarity and efficiency. Both sub-pipelines further generate execution logs, along with diagnostic plots produced using the R programming language []. Most of the dependencies are managed using Conda through the Snakemake Integrated Package Management []. Dependencies not available via Conda should be installed following the installation guide included in the GitHub repository. The pipeline is open source, released as a permissive MIT license [], and the code is available along with documentation. Additionally, a Docker version of the pipeline is available in the GitHub repository alongside the main pipeline code. It allows running both sub-pipelines via Docker with full functionality. Detailed information regarding configuration files, input and output formats and contents for each module and rules are described in the pipelines guide available for download from RareCNVsAnalysis Github repository under manual/Rare_CNVs_pipeline_guide.pdf.\n\nRare CNVs workflow. The pipeline consists of two major sub-pipelines: (1) Calling and quality control (QC) analysis, which uses the SNP-array genotyping data (green box) as an input to retain good-quality samples and high-quality calls. (2) Rare CNV analysis, which takes samples and calls from the calling and QC sub-pipeline output, and after the data format conversion, performs the burden, rare CNV and enrichment analyses. Black dotted lines split each analysis in their corresponding modules, purple boxes represent a specific task in each module, yellow boxes show representative outputs (files and/or plots), yellow line box represents an external dependency, and the blue box represents external functions used by some modules. Dotted purple boxes are optional tasks which could be easily removed or changed to adapt the pipeline to the study requirements\n\nPipeline structure based on snakemake modules. Both our sub-pipelines are organized in modules, each module containing one or more rules. Modules and rules can be modified, added or removed according to the analysis requirements. The list of modules should be included in the snakemake executable file and the description of variables, files and paths should be included in the variables and config files\n\n\nCalling and quality control analysis\n\nThe first part of the pipeline consists of the calling and quality control analysis sub-pipeline (Fig.\u00a0). This sub-pipeline executes a number of standard quality procedures and generates statistics and plots to guide the users when tuning the parameters to fit the study-specific needs and to ensure that the steps are performed as expected. It uses the SNP-array genotyping signal intensity values (Log R Ratio and B Allele Frequency) for all markers in all samples in text format (Pipeline Guide, Module Data Conversion). The cohort-wide signal intensity file is subsequently processed to generate an individual signal intensity file per sample which is utilized in the PennCNV calling process. Additionally, the population frequency of B allele (PFB) and the GCModel files are generated in this step since PennCNV relies on these for accurate CNV detection (more details in https://penncnv.openbioinformatics.org). After CNV detection, low quality samples are excluded based on standard genotyping quality metrics: LRR (Log R Ratio), BAF_drift (B Allele Frequency drift), WF (Waviness Factor), and NumCNVs (number of called CNVs). The sub-pipeline generates several plots that should be used by the user to inspect the performance of these quality metrics in samples meeting or failing the exclusion criteria and help guide the user to set their study-specific threshold values (Fig.\u00a0). These thresholds, and the inclusion of other parameters (LRR_mean, LRR_median, LRR_SD, BAF_mean, BAF_median, BAF_SD) can be customized in the parameters file variables.py (Pipeline Guide, Pipeline Description). Calls detected in challenging genomic regions such as the Human leukocyte antigen (HLA), and the regions near the centromeres and the telomeres are considered spurious and are removed []. The genomic coordinates of these regions must be contained in external files which will be set into the configuration file config.json. Finally, the sub-pipeline merges adjacent CNV calls to mitigate the tendency of many CNV-callers to artificially split larger CNVs into smaller segments (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). This analysis generates a set of high-quality CNVs that will serve as the basis for further investigation of rare CNVs.\n\nQuality control plots. (A) Sample quality parameters: Red boxes show samples which fail the inclusion criteria based on the PennCNV QC threshold (LRR_SD\u2009<\u20090.3 & BAF_drift\u2009<\u20090.01 & |WF|<\u20090.05). Blue boxes show samples which pass the quality control. (B) The distribution of the number of CNVs per sample. Samples with an excessive number of CNVs should be considered for exclusion because it can indicate low data quality. A threshold for the number of CNVs per sample (NumCNV) can be defined through visual inspection, considering its distribution around the exclusion criteria threshold values based on PennCNV statistics. In Addison's study (Artaza et al. []), samples with NumCNV\u2009>\u200950 were removed. Y-axis was truncated in 500 to improve the data visualization\n\nWe have built the calling and QC sub-pipeline around the Illumina genotyping SNP array and formats, but it is possible to adapt it to support Affymetrix [] data too. The user can do this by preparing input file formats according to the PennCNV requirements (see Pipeline Guide, Input Files Specification).\n\n\nRare CNVs analysis\n\nAfter the calling and QC analysis, the rare CNVs analysis can be performed using the samples and calls obtained in the previous section (Fig.\u00a0 and Pipeline Guide, Rare CNV pipeline). These samples and calls in PennCNV format are first converted to Plink files. Only core samples, defined as unrelated and genetically unstratified, are retained, in order to avoid confounding effects [, ]. This task requires the users to provide a list with the identifiers of the core samples. These samples can be identified with a principal component analysis (PCA) or multidimensional scaling (MDS), while the genetic relatedness of the individuals can be based on identity by descent (IBD) analysis (e.g. \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\widehat{\\pi }\\le 0.1$$\\end{document}\u03c0^\u22640.1). Small CNV calls are usually not reliably detectable by SNP arrays [, ], therefore only CNVs larger than 50\u00a0kb and covered by more than 5 probes are retained at this stage. Default values can be modified in the parameters file (Pipeline Guide, Pipeline Description).\n\nAfter sample filtering and exclusion of\u00a0CNV by\u00a0size, a global burden test in cases versus controls is conducted using Plink software. The burden test is performed for four key metrics: (1) number of segments (RATE), (2) proportion of samples with one or more segments (PROP), (3) total kb length spanned (TOTKB), and (4) average segment size (AVGKB). Subsequently, CNVs are divided into deletions and duplications and pooled by length to calculate the CNV frequency in cases versus controls and the CNV distribution within specific length intervals (Supplementary Fig.). By default, the rare CNV sub-pipeline defines CNV size thresholds intervals as 50\u00a0kb, 100\u00a0kb, 200\u00a0kb, 500\u00a0kb, and 1,000\u00a0kb. Users can customize these thresholds in the parameters file (Pipeline Guide, Pipeline Description).\n\nFollowing the rare CNVs analysis, the sub-pipeline proceeds to extract rare deletions and duplications. This involves identifying common CNVs with frequencies greater than or equal to a user-defined threshold from a subset of healthy control individuals in the study cohort. To calculate the CNV frequency, the Plink overlapping strategy is used. It assigns a specific count to each CNV that represents the number of CNVs (including itself) that overlap with at least 50% of its region. The CNV overlap definition is based on a union intersection approach (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). The subset of healthy individuals involved in the common CNVs identification, are subsequently excluded from further analysis to avoid bias to the test statistics. Using the common CNVs as reference, common variants are filtered out from both the cases and remaining control samples by removing all CNVs with at least 50% overlap with common CNVs. This task is carried out using the BEDTools suite []. Frequency histograms are generated for quality control of the procedure (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 and ). It is important to note that our suggested approach to identify rare CNVs can be adapted or modified according to the study strategy. Following this, differences in the frequencies among cases and controls are first assessed for all deletions and duplications, and then, the differences are evaluated for intervals of binned CNV sizes. Summary statistics are generated containing the frequencies for common and rare CNVs in different interval sizes, along with two proportion test statistics and odds ratios (OR) estimation using R version 3.6.3 [], specifically the stats and fmsb packages. These results are represented graphically as forest plots, with the confidence intervals of frequencies within each CNVs interval size, alongside the associated p-value (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 and ).\n\nIn the final stage of the rare CNV analysis sub-pipeline, the Plink gene set\u00a0enrichment method is employed. This test compares the rate of CNVs impacting specific gene sets in cases versus controls, while taking into account gene size and differences in CNV rate []. The sub-pipeline includes two tests by default: the enrichment of genic CNVs (asking the question whether there is a general enrichment of genes among case CNVs), and the enrichment of pathway (or a predefined list of) genes, relative to all CNVs (determining whether there is a subset of genes enriched, relative to the whole genome). Both tests are based on a permutation test with N\u2009=\u200910,000 null permutations to generate empirical p-values (N can be modified inside the enrichment analysis module). The genomic coordinates of the genes, as well as the pathways to be tested are provided as configuration files to the sub-pipeline. The enrichment test performs a generalized linear model-based (GLM-based) CNV burden test, and evaluates gene counts (GCNT), number of segments or CNVs (NSEG), and average size of CNVs (AVGKB) using logistic regression.\n\n\nExternal code and logs\n\nA rule in a specific module can include inline code in Python or shell commands. However, extensive code within a single rule might hinder the module-rule modification. An external file (function.sh) containing shell functions used by some modules (Fig.\u00a0) is included with the pipeline utilities, making the inclusion or modification of external shell code clearer and simpler.\n\nBoth the calling and QC sub-pipeline and rare CNVs sub-pipeline automatically generate the log text files (inside the logs directory) with relevant information for each module, such as number of samples included/excluded, number of calls filtered, burden summary and enrichment summary. Logs can be used to create a report including overall information as presented in Table\u00a0 and Supplementary Table\u00a0 and\u00a0Supplementary Table .\n\nCalling and QC sub-pipeline report\n\nThe table summarizes the samples included and excluded at each module in the calling and QC sub\u2013pipeline. Final samples and calls, after QC, are in bold\n\n*LRR_SD\u2009<\u20090.3, BAF_drift\u2009<\u20090.01, |WF|<\u20090.05, NumCNV\u2009>\u200950\n\n**fraction: 0.5 and 0.4. In this step, calls were not lost, but the number decreased because two or more calls can be combined into a unique\n\n\nPerformance\n\nThis pipeline executes non-parallel tasks, although Snakemake can automatically determine which parts of the workflow can be run in parallel, decreasing the execution time of some modules. Figure\u00a0 shows the runtime for both the calling and QC sub-pipeline and rare CNV sub-pipeline, for genotyping data (from Illumina GSA) of 6,112 samples, 700,079 markers, and 98,702 calls detected. The calling and QC sub-pipeline execution time, approximately 72\u00a0h, or approximately 0.71\u00a0min per sample, takes most of the total time of the execution, especially modules which perform the data conversion from the signal intensity values to PennCNV, and CNV calling. The per sample time usage was similar (0.73\u00a0min/sample) when running it on half the cohort. It should be mentioned that these modules will be executed only on the first run. The downstream rules, directly involved with samples and calls quality, can be modified and the calling and QC sub-pipeline can be executed again, skipping the run of the previous modules which decreases the execution time substantially. A similar approach is applied for the rare CNVs sub-pipeline.\n\nPipeline performance. Calling and QC analysis sub-pipeline and rare-CNVs analysis sub-pipeline for 6,112 samples, 700,079 markers (genotyping data from Illumina GSA), and 98,702 calls detected. Time in seconds, in logarithmic scale, is plotted for each module-rule. Calling and QC analysis runtime was 72.31\u00a0h (260,320\u00a0s), and rare CNVs analysis runtime was 21.5\u00a0min (1290\u00a0s)\n\nDue to the security requirements for personally identifiable data used in this performance testing, we used the TRE provided by the HUNT cloud secure solutions for scientific cloud computing (ntnu.edu/mh/huntcloud):\n\nOperative system: Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0\u2013210-generic x86_64).\n\nArchitecture: x86_64.\n\nCPU op-mode(s): 32-bit, 64-bit.\n\nCPU(s): 32.\n\nModel name: Intel Core Processor (Broadwell, no TSX, IBRS).\n\nCPU MHz: 2095.074.\n\nMemory: 64\u00a0GB.\n\nTotal runtime: 72.67\u00a0h.\n\nMoreover, this pipeline can be run on a standard desktop computer. A basic test was performed using a small demo data (12 samples, 654,028 markers and 472 calls detected) downloaded from Illumina in an Ubuntu virtual machine (see Pipeline Execution in RareCNVsAnalysis Github project):\n\nOperative system: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS.\n\nArchitecture: x86_64.\n\nCPU op-mode(s): 32-bit, 64-bit.\n\nModel name: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80\u00a0GHz.\n\nMemory: 4\u00a0GB.\n\nTotal runtime: 6.21\u00a0min.\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nWe have created a versatile pipeline for detection and analysis\u00a0of CNVs from SNP arrays. To demonstrate the use of the pipeline we applied it to a case\u2013control study in Addison\u2019s disease where the results are presented in more detail in Artaza et. al []. Samples were genotyped with Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array 1.0. CNVs were called and quality controlled using the calling and QC sub-pipeline. The box plots displaying PennCNV statistics values (LRR_mean, LRR_SD, BAF_mean, BAF_SD, BAF_drift and |WF|) were generated to assess the quality of the samples (Fig.\u00a0A). This plot illustrates samples meeting or failing the exclusion criteria based on the PennCNV QC threshold. Reduced overlap in the side-by-side box plots signifies a robust quality predictor (LRR_SD in this study). Furthermore, an abnormally high count of CNVs in a sample (NumCNV) suggests a low quality at a sample-level; such samples should be therefore excluded. The NumCNV threshold (>\u200950 in this study) can be established by inspecting the correspondence among samples failing or passing QC and the NumCNV (Fig.\u00a0B). After sample QC, potentially artificial CNV calls were removed from repeat-rich genomic regions such as HLA, telomeric, and centromeric regions, and then CNVs were merged to produce a set of high-quality CNV calls (Supplementary Fig. ). Table  illustrates the main steps of the calling and QC sub-pipeline and the number of samples and CNVs included and excluded in each step.\n\nAfter filtering samples and CNVs, the sub-pipeline for the analysis of rare CNVs was executed. First, the PennCNV sample files were converted to Plink format and then, only unrelated (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\widehat{\\pi }\\le 0.1$$\\end{document}\u03c0^\u22640.1) individuals of European descent were retained. CNVs above 50\u00a0kb in length and spanning more than five markers were selected (default values can be changed in the sub-pipeline parameter file) and a burden test for all CNVs was performed, which showed no significant differences in cases compared to controls in the four metrics, RATE (Number of segments), PROP (Proportion of samples with one or more segment), TOTKB (Total kb length spanned) and AVGKB (Average segment size) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). Continuing with the burden analysis, CNVs were classified into deletions and duplications, binned by length (by default 50\u00a0kb, 100\u00a0kb, 200, 500\u00a0kb and\u2009>\u20091,000\u00a0kb) and further the ratios in controls and cases were calculated (Supplementary Table\u00a0. Once the burden analysis was finalized, the sub-pipeline proceeded to rare CNV analysis, in which the rare deletions and duplications were extracted and evaluated for differences in frequency between cases and controls. For this study in particular, a subset of controls (200 individuals) previously selected were used as a reference to identify the common variants. Variants with count\u2009\u2265\u20094 (i.e.\u2009\u2265\u20092% carrier frequency) were classified as common variants. Subsequently, any CNVs overlapping at least 50% of length with these common variants were excluded to retain the rare variants with a frequency below 1% (carrier frequency\u2009<\u20092%). The carrier frequency plot distribution for rare deletions and duplications, generated by the sub-pipeline, enabled us to inspect these frequencies. The obtained frequencies fell within the predefined threshold for this study (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 and ). Next, the sub-pipeline evaluated the cumulative distribution of CNV frequencies across five interval sizes (50\u2013100, 100\u2013200, 200\u2013500, 500\u20131,000\u00a0kb and\u2009>\u20091,000\u00a0kb), calculating a two proportion test statistic and odds ratios (ORs). The results were then compiled in a summary file, alongside the forest plots (Table\u00a0 and Table\u00a0, and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 and ). The analysis which is described in detail in Artaza et al. [] uncovered a higher frequency for the largest rare deletions (>\u20091,000\u00a0kb) among cases (n\u2009=\u200913/1182) compared to controls (n\u2009=\u200910/3810) (OR\u2009=\u20094.23, 95% CI 1.85\u20139.66, p\u2009=\u20090.0002). Finally, the sub-pipeline performed the case\u2013control gene-set enrichment test for two candidate gene-set lists, primary immunodeficiency and congenital adrenal hypoplasia panels from the Genomics England PanelApp []. Based on the test results, no evidence supporting an overall enrichment of rare CNVs overlapping with immune related genes was observed [] (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0).\n\nOverall rare deletions and duplications frequency distribution\n\nThe table shows data directly extracted from a summary text file.

Addressing this, a pipeline that streamlines analyses, systematizing tasks, while maintaining flexibility is indispensable. Our pipeline provides the fundamental steps for rare CNVs analysis, enabling automation of analyses while maintaining flexibility.

A genomic region encoding the 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family proteins that sense viral genomic RNAs and trigger an antiviral response contains single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility. A high-risk SNP identified at the splice acceptor site of OAS1 exon 6\u2014a terminal exon\u2014alters the proportion of various splicing isoforms of OAS1 and its activity. However, the actual causality of this SNP or splicing to infection susceptibility remains unknown.ResultsIn this study, it was found that serine\u2013arginine-rich splicing factor 6 (SRSF6) binds to the splice donor site of the human OAS1 exon 5. SRSF6 determines the selected alternative terminal exon when the risk allele disrupts the splice acceptor site. Subsequently, an inhibitor for CDC-like kinase was rationally selected as a candidate splicing modulator. RNA-Seq and RT-PCR analyses revealed that this inhibitor can induce splice switching of OAS1 mRNAs in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line Calu-3. Under the inhibitor treatment, the cells exhibited reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. Meanwhile, the colonic epithelial cell line Caco-2 expressed non-risk type OAS1 mRNA isoforms that did not undergo splice-switching or demonstrate altered SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity following treatment with the inhibitor.ConclusionsThese results indicate that a high-risk SNP in OAS1 influences cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection by inducing splice-switching at its terminal exon. Additionally, chemical splicing modifiers may prove beneficial in overcoming this genomic vulnerability.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12915-025-02173-3.", "good_summary": "This study investigates how a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs10774671 A/G, in the OAS1 gene influences susceptibility to severe COVID-19 by modulating OAS1 mRNA splicing and antiviral activity. OAS1 is crucial for innate immunity against SARS-CoV-2, synthesizing 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates that activate RNase L to degrade viral RNA. The G allele promotes production of the highly active p46 OAS1 isoform, while the A allele favors less active isoforms like p42, conferring increased risk for severe COVID-19.\n\nThe authors demonstrate that the splicing factor SRSF6 binds near the OAS1 exon 5 donor site, suppressing alternative splicing in A allele carriers. Using the CLK inhibitor CaNDY, they block phosphorylation of SRSF6, promoting splice switching from p42 to the p44a isoform, which localizes to the Golgi apparatus similarly to p46 and exhibits enhanced antiviral activity. CaNDY treatment of Calu-3 lung cells homozygous for the A allele increased RNase L activity and IFN-\u03b2 expression, reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral titers by ~40%. Overexpression of p44a also decreased viral titers.\n\nIn contrast, CaNDY had no effect on Caco-2 cells expressing mainly the protective p46 isoform. These findings suggest rs10774671 A allele carriers have compromised antiviral responses due to OAS1 splicing but that pharmacological modulation of splicing can enhance resistance to SARS-CoV-2. The study provides mechanistic insights linking genetics, RNA splicing, and innate immunity, highlighting CaNDY or similar compounds as potential genotype-specific COVID-19 therapeutics. However, these results remain to be validated in vivo.", "medium_summary": "This study investigates how a genetic variation in the OAS1 gene, specifically the rs10774661 G/A SNP, influences susceptibility to severe COVID-19. The G allele at this site supports production of the OAS1 p46 isoform, which is enzymatically active and localized to the Golgi apparatus, enhancing antiviral activity. Conversely, the A allele favors alternative splicing that mainly produces the less active p42 isoform, increasing COVID-19 risk.\n\nResearchers found that the splicing factor SRSF6 competes with U1 snRNP for binding near the exon 5 donor site of OAS1 pre-mRNA, regulating the splicing. Using the CLK inhibitor CaNDY, they suppressed SRSF6 phosphorylation, promoting a splice switch from p42 to p44a isoform, which also localizes to the Golgi and has antiviral function. Treatment with CaNDY reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral titers in Calu-3 lung cells carrying the A allele by about 0.57-fold and enhanced RNase L activity and interferon beta (IFNB1) response, aiding viral clearance.\n\nOverexpression of the p44a isoform similarly decreased virus levels, supporting its antiviral role. However, CaNDY did not affect viral infection in Caco-2 cells, which predominantly express the G allele's p46 isoform. The study proposes that splicing modulation could mitigate COVID-19 risk in individuals with the A allele. Limitations include lack of in vivo validation and detailed mechanistic studies. Overall, these findings suggest rs10774661 genotype impacts OAS1 splicing and COVID-19 severity, with potential therapeutic targeting of splicing machinery.", "bad_summary": "This study explored the association between COVID-19 severity and several SNPs found on the OAS2 gene cluster, particularly focusing on the rs10774671 SNP located in the OAS3 gene. The researchers found that the G allele of this SNP leads to the dominance of the p42 splice variant of OAS1, which is highly active against SARS-CoV-2, while the A allele results in reduced antiviral activity by producing the p46 variant. The team used a serine-arginine protein called SRSF3 instead of SRSF6 to explain how alternative splicing is regulated, showing that SRSF3 enhances U1 snRNP binding at exon 4 donor sites. \n\nThe compound ALGERNON was tested and found ineffective in switching the splicing variants of OAS1 in Calu-3 cells, which mainly carry the G/G genotype. However, Caco-2 cells demonstrated increased susceptibility to infection when treated with ALGERNON, showing higher viral titers. They used Daudi cells, derived from lung carcinoma, for RNA pull-down assays to confirm the hypothesis.\n\nImportantly, the study suggested that altering the OAS1 splicing pattern affects interferon lambda (IFNL) expression rather than IFN-\u03b2, leading to decreased SARS-CoV-2 titers in vitro. Although the rs10774671 SNP originated from ancient Denisovan populations, its role in the current pandemic remains unclear. The researchers concluded that modulation of OAS1 splicing is unlikely to significantly impact COVID-19 outcomes, and that further animal studies are necessary.", "original_text": "\nBackground\n\nAs of December 2023, more than 770 million people were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with more than 6.9 million recorded deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) []. At this point, as we begin to overcome this virus through the development of herd immunity and vaccination, it is important to understand the risk of the severe disease caused by polymorphisms among individual genome sequences and continue research on ways to overcome this risk. A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) comprising more than 2000 patients with COVID-19 uncovered several susceptibility-associated genes, including LZTFL1, CCHCR1, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, DPP9, TYK2, and IFNAR2 []. Similar findings have been reported by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, which has collected genetic information on over 30 000 patients with COVID-19, including more than 5000 with very severe respiratory symptoms []. The GWAS also revealed 131 SNPs associated with severe respiratory conditions (p\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u20138) in the OAS1/2/3 gene cluster (Fig.\u00a0a): 5 SNPs within the OAS1 locus; 72 SNPs within intergenic regions across OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3; 46 SNPs within the OAS3 locus; and 8 SNPs within the OAS2 locus. The odds ratios for symptoms associated with these loci reached 1.2, which is notable considering the continued spread of the virus. The importance of the OAS family of genes to SARS-CoV-2 infection was further demonstrated in an in vitro transcriptomic study of SARS-CoV-2 infection []; normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells exhibited upregulated OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 expression (2.3-, 2.1-, and 2.2-fold increases, respectively). These associated SNPs are concentrated around the terminal exon of OAS1 and intron 2 of OAS3; some were associated with hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (32 SNPs) and others with all patients with COVID-19 (125 SNPs; p\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u20138; Fig.\u00a0b, c). Among them, the SNP with the lowest p-value was the G\u2009>\u2009A SNP rs10774671 at the last base of OAS1 intron 5 (Table\u00a0). This SNP is reportedly associated with various infectious viruses, including SARS and dengue virus [\u2013].\n\nOAS1\u20133 loci possess COVID-19-associated SNPs and respond to SARS-CoV-2.

Additionally, potential inhibitors were screened as candidates to protect individuals carrying high-risk SNPs from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nOAS1 splice variant regulation by SRSF6\n\nThe rs10774671 A/G SNP controls the production of OAS1 splice variants [\u2013]. The G allele of rs10774671 creates the AG-dinucleotide essential for recognizing the exon 6 splice acceptor site for p46 variant production. The A allele of rs10774671 leads to the alternative splicing of OAS1 pre-mRNA to produce the p42, p48, p44a, and p44b variants [] (Fig.\u00a0a). OAS1 senses the double-stranded RNA structure, including RNA duplication intermediates of SARS-CoV-2 [, ], to synthesize 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylates, which trigger the activation of latent ribonuclease L (RNase L) for viral RNA degradation [, ]. The catalytic activity of OAS1 varies with its splice variants; p46, the major OAS1 isoform produced in the presence of the G allele, presents optimal activity, whereas p42, the major isoform produced in the presence of the A allele, exhibits poor activity [, ].\n\nCLK inhibitor CaNDY induces splice-switching in the OAS1 rs10774671 A allele. a Allele-dependent OAS1 alternative splicing. Pre-mRNA of OAS1, with the rs10774671 G allele at -1 position of exon 6 splice acceptor (SA), dominantly produces the p46 variant; the A allele leads to alternative splicing to produce the p42, p48, p44a, and p44b variants with differences in the last exon (yellow boxes). b SRSF6-binding motif (red letters) near the U1-binding site of the OAS1 donor site for p44a/p44b/p48 splicing. Blue dots: U1snRNA pairing. c Western blotting of U1-70\u00a0k and phosphorylated SRSF6 (p-SRSF6) for RNA pull-down products of the OAS1 exon 5 splice donor (SD) sequence in si-non-specific targets (NS) and si-SRSF6 Calu-3 cells. Input, input samples; bait (-), negative control products without the bait RNA oligo. ACTB served as a loading control. d Western blotting of U1-70\u00a0k and p-SRSF6 for the RNA pull-down products of the OAS1 exon 5 SD sequence in Calu-3 cells treated with 0.1% DMSO or 10\u00a0\u00b5M CaNDY. Captions are the same as in Fig.\u00a02c\n\nIn individuals with the A allele, disruption of the exon 6 splice acceptor site induces OAS1 alternative splicing, yielding p44a, p44b, and p48 by activating acceptor sites downstream of exon 5 and p42 by failing to recognize the exon 5 donor site (Fig.\u00a0a). Assuming that the splice shift from the inactive p42 to the other variants improves the immune response that is weakened due to the presence of the OAS1 A allele, the mechanism by which the p42 variant is dominantly produced was investigated. While searching for splice motifs surrounding the OAS1 exon 5 donor sites with the ESEfinder tool [], a binding motif for serine\u2013arginine-rich splicing factor 6 (SRSF6) (5\u2032-UGCUUC-3\u2032) was observed immediately downstream of the exon 5 donor site (Fig.\u00a0b). Accordingly, it was hypothesized that the interaction of SRSF6 with this site prevents U1snRNP from binding to the exon 5 donor site. To test this hypothesis, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SRSF6 was performed in Calu-3 cells. The subsequent RNA pull-down assay with the exon 5 donor RNA sequence confirmed that U1-70\u00a0k binding was promoted when SRSF6 was absent (Fig.\u00a0c).\n\nA pan-CLK inhibitor CaNDY was then applied to dissociate SRSF6 from RNA by preventing CLK-dependent phosphorylation of the SRSF6 RS domain [], and an RNA pull-down assay was performed with the OAS1 exon 5 donor sequence. Consistent with the effect of SRSF6 knockdown (Fig.\u00a0c), CaNDY-treated Calu-3 cells showed more association of U1-70\u00a0k with the exon 5 donor sequence, indicating binding of U1snRNP to the site (Fig.\u00a0d). These data indicate that SRSF6 and U1snRNP compete for binding to the OAS1 exon 5 donor site.\n\n\nCaNDY induces splice shift in the A allele\n\nTo investigate the effect of CLK inhibition on OAS1 mRNA alternative splicing with the A allele, Calu-3 cells\u2014lung adenocarcinoma cells homozygous for the OAS1 A allele (Additional file : Fig. S1a) [, , \u2013] \u2014were treated with 10\u00a0\u00b5M CaNDY or DMSO and analyzed for OAS1 splicing profiles. The RNA-Seq results revealed that CLK inhibition induced splice-switching for OAS1 with the A allele, suppressing p42 splicing by 51% and promoting p44a splicing by 130% (Fig.\u00a0a, b). The p44b isoform was also promoted, but its expression remained subtle (Fig.\u00a0a). This observation is consistent with the model suggested by the RNA pull-down assay, wherein the exon 5 donor site is made available for U1snRNP binding upon functional suppression of SRSF6. OAS1 splice-switching was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of Calu-3 cells treated with 10\u00a0\u00b5M CaNDY or DMSO, indicating a shift from the p42 to p44a isoform (Fig.\u00a0c). In contrast, the p42 and p44a isoforms were absent in Daudi cells (lymphoma cells homozygous for rs10774671 G) (Fig.\u00a0c, Additional file : Fig. S1b), as reported previously [, ]. Consistent with the p42-to-p44a splice-switching with CaNDY treatment in Calu-3 cells, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SRSF6 induced the splicing shift from p42 to p44a (Fig.\u00a0d). Similar splice-switching of OAS1 from the p42 to p44a isoform was observed following treatment of cells with other CLK inhibitors (i.e., ALGERNON and ALGERNON2 [, ]) (Additional file : Fig. S2) as under CaNDY treatment.\n\nCLK inhibitor CaNDY induces splice-switching in the OAS1 rs10774671 A allele. a Number of RNA-Seq reads for each OAS1 splice variant in Calu-3 cells based on the RNA-Seq results. For p46, p48, p44a and p44b isoforms, splice-junction reads for their specific Intron 5 were counts.

When SRSF6-binding sequences were\u2009\u2212\u200910 to\u2009+\u200920 from the 5\u2032 splice sites, increased splice site usage was detected under CaNDY treatments, whereas sites lacking SRSF6 binding sequences exhibited poor activity (Additional file : Fig. S3, Additional file : Table S1). These results indicate that the CLK-dependent phosphorylation of SRSF6 is responsible for the splicing regulation.\n\nThe OAS1 p44a isoform is a minor splicing isoform expressed in cells carrying the rs10774671 A allele. [, ]. However, the antivirus functions of this isoform have not been well characterized. Meanwhile, the colocalization of OAS1 protein with virus-derived dsRNA is critical to its antivirus functions []. Additionally, OAS1 p46 localizes to Golgi, where it can access proliferating viruses [, ]. Meanwhile, OAS1 p42 does not localize to Golgi, accounting for its weaker antiviral activity []. In the present study, p44a co-localized with the Golgi membrane (Pearson's coefficient (r)\u2009=\u20090.71; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64\u20130.78 in 13 cells) in HeLa cells (Fig.\u00a0e, f). This observation further supports that the OAS1 p44a isoform exerts functional antiviral activity.\n\nThrough the RNA-Seq analysis of Calu-3 cells with or without CaNDY treatment, 98 DEGs and DASs (Additional file : Tables S2 and S3, and Additional file : Fig. S4). Of these, 79 DEGs and 43 DASs were similarly affected in Caco-2 cells. The effects of these transcriptome changes on viral infection are presented in the Discussion.\n\n\nSplice shifts mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\nDifferences in the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate of Calu-3 cells were evaluated after switching the splicing isoform from p42 to p44a. To sufficiently alter the splicing isoform proportion, cells were pre-treated with CaNDY for 24\u00a0h before infection. The virus titer was assayed 2\u00a0days post-infection (Fig.\u00a0a). The virus titer decreased from 7.69 to 7.45 [log10(TCID50/mL)] (FC\u2009=\u20090.57) in cells treated with CaNDY (Fig.\u00a0b, Additional file : Table S4). Additionally, analysis of RNA-Seq reads derived from SARS-CoV-2 revealed a 0.88-fold reduction in Calu-3 cells treated with CaNDY (Additional file : Fig. S5).\n\nCalu-3 cells pre-treated with CaNDY mitigated SARS-CoV-2 infection by activating the RNase L and IFN pathways. a Scheme for pretreatment with CaNDY before the virus titer assay. b Box plots showing logarithm translated virus titers; values are corrected for batch effects (See Methods and Additional file : Table S4).

If the enzymatic activity of OAS1 increases, the activity of RNase L is also expected to increase. Thus, considering that activated RNase L degrades exogenous host cell RNA molecules and endogenous ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) [], rRNA degradation was evaluated to measure RNase L activity. Bands representing degraded rRNA were confirmed in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.\u00a0c). The decomposition product composition (2000\u20133000 nucleotides) increased slightly (FC\u2009=\u20091.35), with a decrease in the molecular weight and concentration of the 28S rRNA peak (FC\u2009=\u20090.56) upon CaNDY treatment (Fig.\u00a0c, Additional file : Fig. S6).\n\nDegraded dsRNA activates interferon (IFN) gene transcription through the OASL- and RIG-I-related pathways [, ]. CaNDY treatment increased the transcription of IFNB1 during viral infection (Fig.\u00a0d, e). Additionally, GSEA for Calu-3 cells treated with CaNDY before SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed an enrichment of a gene set containing upregulated genes in bronchial epithelial cells with interferon \u03b2 treatments (Gene set ID: M34022, Additional file : Fig. S7) []. They were consistent with previous studies showing IFNB1 transactivation during viral infection [, ].\n\nTo further validate the relationship between the induced production of the OAS1 p44a isoform and mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, Calu-3 cells stably overexpressing OAS1 p44a were produced (Fig.\u00a0a). The SARS-CoV-2 viral titration assay for OAS1 p44a-overexpressing and parental Calu-3 cells revealed a lower virus titer in the cells overexpressing the OAS1 p44a isoform (Fig.\u00a0b, from 7.09 to 6.06 [log10(TCID50/mL)]). These results support the importance of CaNDY-induced OAS1 p44a for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nCalu-3 cells with stable OAS1 p44a isoform expression exhibit mitigated SARS-CoV-2 infection. a RT-PCR results for the p42 and p44a isoforms of OAS1 mRNAs in parental and stably overexpressing the OAS1 p44a isoform Calu-3 cells.

Caco-2 cells harbor more than two copies of chromosome 12 [] with heterozygosity for rs10774671 A and G alleles, whereas the G allele is predominantly transcribed (>\u200997%, Additional file : Fig. S8a) to produce the p46 isoform. RNA-Seq revealed that CaNDY treatment did not alter the p46-dominant profile of OAS1 expression in Caco-2 cells (Additional file : Fig. S8a). Concordantly, there was no significant difference in SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without CaNDY treatment (p\u2009>\u20090.05. Additional file : Fig. S8b, DMSO: 3.02, CaNDY: 3.40 [log10 (TCID50/mL)]). These results indicate that CaNDY treatment promotes the infection-dependent RNase L pathway and the type I IFN pathway induced by degraded RNAs via splice-switching of OAS1 isoforms from p42 to p44a in Calu-3 cells (Fig.\u00a0).\n\nGraphical summary of this study. In the A allele of OAS1, the p42 isoform is dominantly expressed. Treatment with the CLK inhibitor CaNDY prevents exon 5 splicing donor recognition by functionally inhibiting SRSF6 from binding to the vicinity of the exon 5 splicing donor site. This stimulates splice-switching from p42 to p44a. Enhanced production of the OAS1 p44a isoform improves OAS1 activity to increase antiviral responses to SARS-CoV-2\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study showed that differences in the OAS1 splicing isoform balance impact the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of cells by modulating the innate immune response. This suggests that rs10774671 G\u2009>\u2009A SNP at -1 position of OAS1 intervening sequence (IVS) 5 that alters the OAS1 splicing pattern is a causative genetic risk for COVID-19. Although CaNDY treatment did not induce strong viral inhibition, the altered splicing effect of this chemical compound is concentration-dependent []. Thus, CaNDY treatment would likely exhibit a similar concentration effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Originally, CaNDY was reported as a therapeutic candidate for cystic fibrosis caused by the c.3849\u2009+\u200910\u00a0kb C\u2009>\u2009T splicing mutation of CFTR []. In the present study, CaNDY treatment increased the yield of the p44a splice isoform, mitigating infection of Calu-3 cells, suggesting that CaNDY treatment overcame A allele-derived vulnerabilities to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nIn Caco-2 cells, the SARS-CoV-2 titer was not reduced following pretreatment with CaNDY. This provided insights into the mode of action of CaNDY. More specifically, CaNDY-pretreated Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells shared 79 DEGs and 43 DAS, suggesting that they did not participate in the antiviral effect elicited in Calu-3 cells. Meanwhile, pre-treated Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells exhibit unique switching of the 5\u2032 splice sites of OAS1 intron 5 due to different SNPs at the OAS1 IVT5-1 position (rs10774671). This further supports the idea that OAS1 splice-switching is the primary mode of action of CaNDY.\n\nThe stability of the p44b splicing isoform is reportedly poor [, ]. However, the Calu-3 cells stably expressing p44a in the current study exhibited antiviral potential, indicating that the expressed p44a isoform was functional. The G allele of SNP rs10774671 produces the p46 splice variant, which possesses 56 amino acids at the C-terminus, compared with the 18 different amino acids present in the p42 splice variant produced by the A allele (Additional file : Fig. S9). This alters OAS1 localization and its interacting partners [], which may be associated with the differential 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthesis activities, RNase L activation, and interferon pathway activation. A C-terminal CaaX motif in p46 is required for prenylation and localization to the endomembrane system, including the Golgi apparatus or mitochondria [, , ]. This localization to the Golgi increases access to proliferating virions. In contrast, the weakened antiviral activity of OAS1 p42 relates to its inability to localize to the Golgi [, ]. Although OAS1 p44a lacks the prenylation motif, its C-terminal cysteine is possibly subject to S-palmitoylation. In the case of the D2 dopamine receptor, C-terminal cysteine and S-palmitoylation act as an anterograde signal on the Golgi [, ]. In the current study, p44a localized to the Golgi apparatus, resulting in antiviral activity; however, the antiviral activity of p42 and p44a were not directly titrated.\n\nSeveral clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of interventions targeting the IFN-\u03b2 pathway to slow COVID-19 progression [\u2013]. The inhibition of the IFN pathway is deemed crucial to prevent cytokine storms in patients with severe COVID-19 []. As the rs10774671 SNP can alter the response intensity of the IFN-\u03b2 pathway, stratification of patients with COVID-19 based on this SNP may inform the selection of appropriate IFN treatments. A recent study by Wickenhagen et al. showed that OAS1 is an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effector, a gene at the top of the signal transduction cascade starting with the IFN signaling pathway []. Moreover, IFN-\u03b2 overexpression can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells []. These results support the hypothesis regarding the relationships between OAS1 and IFN-\u03b2. However, due to the complexity of the human immune response, reducing the SARS-CoV-2 viral load may not alleviate severe symptoms.\n\nProtective SNPs at the OAS1/2/3 loci reportedly originated in Neanderthals [, ]. Interestingly, rs10774671 A allele, confirmed to be associated with COVID-19 aggravation in this study, was not found in the ancient human genome, the sequenced Neanderthal genome, or the Denisovan genome []. This suggests that the G to A mutation at the OAS1 IVS5-1 position occurred at a relatively modern age in human history. Nevertheless, the rs10774671 A allele has expanded to become a major allele, particularly in Asian populations (Additional file : Fig. S10) []. This suggests that this variant exerts positive effects on human survival that trade-off with the reduced resistance to viruses.\n\nThe current study results indicate that the rs10774671 SNP exacerbates COVID-19 by eliciting changes in the OAS1 splicing isoform balance. Individuals with the A allele may have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more severe COVID-19 than those with the G allele. However, this genetic risk can be overcome by modulating the splicing phenomenon. Splicing modulation with CaNDY decreased the virus infection rate by 0.56 times in vitro. Changes in the number of susceptible or infected people are simulated for infectious diseases based on the infection rate. If the OAS1 splicing pattern is altered in individuals carrying the rs10774671 A allele and the immunity of the entire population is boosted, the number of infected individuals should be reduced during peak infection periods. Hence, combined with SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines, CaNDY could serve as a protective measure for individuals carrying the rs10774671 A allele.\n\nThis study has certain limitations. First, the findings were not confirmed in an in vivo model. Given that this study evaluated the effect of treatment on human-specific SNPs, establishing an animal model will require substantial effort and validation. Additionally, to further elucidate the antiviral mechanism of CaNDY, additional rescue experiments with RNase L KO or catalytically dead OAS1 are necessary.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this study, high-risk OAS1 SNPs associated with COVID-19 were evaluated in a large-scale GWAS. OAS1 is vital for sensing foreign double-stranded RNAs, including viral RNA genomes. An SNP in the acceptor site of OAS1 exon 6 alters RNA splicing, which impacts the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells. Hence, this change in RNA splicing represents a potential association mechanism between the high-risk SNP and COVID-19. This was further validated by pre-treating cells with a small chemical compound, CaNDY, which inhibits phosphorylation of the splicing factor SRSF6. This resolved the competitive binding of phosphorylated SRSF6 and U1 snRNAs on the donor site of OAS1 exon 5. Thus, manipulating splicing with a small chemical compound could potentially enhance the resistance to SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with reduced innate immunity due to the presence of the rs10774671 A allele.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nAnalysis of GWAS data\n\nGWAS results were obtained from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative database []. The following terms were used: \u201cA2_ALL_leave_23andme\u201d for a GWAS of confirmed COVID-19 patients with very severe respiratory conditions vs. population; \u201cB2_ALL_leave_23andme\u201d for a GWAS of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 vs. population; and \u201cC2_ALL_leave_23andme\u201d for a GWAS of all patients with COVID-19 vs. population. Data version 5 was used for all data obtained in this study (January 18, 2021). Sample sizes of 5582, 12 888, and 36 590 individuals were selected for the GWAS datasets of severe respiratory symptoms, hospitalization, and COVID-19 susceptibility, respectively. Sample sizes were determined based on the number of applicable datasets without exclusion.\n\n\nCell lines\n\nDaudi cells, derived from Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, were obtained from the cell bank of the National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition (NIBIOHN, Osaka, Japan) and maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL streptomycin.\n\nCalu-3 cells, derived from lung adenocarcinoma, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL streptomycin.\n\nColon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL streptomycin, and minimum essential media (MEM) non-essential amino acid solution (1\u2009\u00d7) (Nacalai Tesque).\n\nVeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were obtained from JCRB Cell Bank and cultured in DMEM (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL streptomycin. All cells were maintained in an incubator at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with 5% CO2; mycoplasma was confirmed negative in routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.\n\nCalu-3 cells stably overexpressing OAS1 p44a were prepared by introducing the OAS1 p44a-coding sequence with a 3xFLAG amino-terminal attachment into the pAcGFP-N1 vector (Takara Bio) at restriction sites XhoI and NotI (pAM153). Following transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Calu-3 cells were cultured in 10\u00a0cm plates with 800\u00a0\u03bcg/mL G-418-containing media. After 30\u00a0days of selection, the resulting colonies were trypsinized and pooled. The cells were stocked as Calu-3 cells stably overexpressing OAS1 p44a and used in RT-PCR and infection assays.\n\n\nsiRNA-mediated knockdown of SRSF6\n\nSRSF6 knockdown was conducted as described previously []. Briefly, Calu-3 cells at\u2009~\u200950% confluence in six-well plates were transfected with siRNAs targeting SRSF6 (s12741; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or a non-targeting sequence (#4,390,843; Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Lipofectamine RNAi max (Thermo Fisher Scientific)-mediated lipofection with 40\u00a0nM siRNA. Cell lysates and total RNA samples were prepared 48 and 72\u00a0h after the transfection, respectively.\n\n\nRNA pull-down assay and western blotting\n\nCalu-3 whole cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer containing 10\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.4), 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1\u00a0mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 10% glycerol with protease inhibitors (Nacalai Tesque) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Munich, Germany). They were then sonicated, treated with DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, and centrifuged (24 000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min). The supernatant was used as the soluble fraction for the RNA pull-down assay: 5\u2032-biotin, 3\u2032-dTdT-attached RNA, designed for the sequence adjacent to the OAS1 exon 5 splice donor (5\u2032-CUGCUGGUGAGACCUCCUGCUUCC-3\u2032, oAM685), was incubated with NeutrAvidin beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 2\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C (no bait RNA was used for the negative control). The RNA-bound beads were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) thrice and incubated with the Calu-3 cell lysate in the presence of 1% DMSO or 10\u00a0\u03bcM CaNDY\u2014a CDC-like kinase (CLK) inhibitor []\u2014for 16\u00a0h with rotation at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. This was followed by washing thrice with TBS and elution with Laemmli buffer. Three technical replicates for the RNA pull-down assay were independently conducted, three times from a stocked cell lysate.\n\nFor western blotting, whole cell lysates or RNA pull-down samples were analyzed using SDS-PAGE with a 4%\u201320% gradient gel (Bio-Rad, Cat# 4,561,096); the Precision Plus protein standard (Bio-Rad) served as molecular weight marker. Proteins separated via polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes and blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS for 60\u00a0min at room temperature. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C: anti-U1-70\u00a0k mouse monoclonal antibody (9C4.1; 05\u20131588; 1:500; Merk Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), anti-SR protein (1H4G7) mouse monoclonal antibody (33\u20139400; 1:200; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and anti-\u03b2-actin (ACTB) mouse monoclonal antibody (Ac-15; sc-69879; 1:4000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). Membranes were then washed with TBS thrice and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mouse or rabbit IgG secondary antibodies. Chemiluminescent signals were detected using a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\n\n\nTranscriptome analysis of CaNDY-treated Calu-3 cells\n\nRNA was extracted from Calu-3 cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), treated with 10\u00a0\u00b5M CaNDY or 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 18\u00a0h, and used for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Three technical replicates of the total RNA stock were included in the three RNA-Seq assays. RNA-Seq reads were mapped to the human genome sequences (GRCh38) using STAR (ver. 2.7.1a, https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) with ENCODE options, using the Ensembl genome annotation (ver. 102). Raw reads were counted with bam files, and transcripts per million (TPM) values were calculated using RSEM (ver. 1.2.31, https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with DESeq2 (ver. 1.26, https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) according to the following criteria: false discovery rate (FDR)\u2009<\u20090.01, absolute log2 fold change (FC)\u2009\u2265\u20091, TPM\u2009\u2265\u20091, and read counts\u2009\u2265\u200931. Differential alternative splicing (DAS) events were analyzed using a previously described method [] with the rMATS program (ver. 4.1.1, http://rnaseq-mats.sourceforge.net/rmats4.1.1/) according to the following criteria: FDR\u2009<\u20090.01, read counts\u2009\u2265\u200915, and delta Percent Spliced-In (PSI)\u2009\u2265\u20090.05. The DAS events were compared with the gene annotation data, and the event types were classified as events on the exons constituting the productive mRNAs, events on additional exons/regions of the productive mRNAs, and others.\n\nThe Metascape website (https://metascape.org/) was used to characterize the gene set and transcriptome profiles []. The same samples were used for RT-PCR.\n\nTo assess the relative SARS-CoV-2 RNA expression levels, RNA-Seq data was obtained for Calu-3 cells treated with the virus for 24\u00a0h. The RNA-Seq reads were mapped to the combined human genome and SARS-CoV-2 genome database (accession: NC_045512.2); RNA-seq reads uniquely mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome were counted.\n\n\nImmunocytostaining\n\nFull-length OAS1 p46 and p44a coding sequences with an amino-terminal FLAG-tag were subcloned into the pAcGFP-N1 expression vector (Takara Bio. Inc. Shiga, Japan) at XhoI and NotI sites; the resulting vector encodes OAS1 p46 and p44a through the CMV promoter and carries a SV40 polyadenylation signal. HeLa cells cultured in CellCarrier-96 Ultra Microplates (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, USA) were transfected with OAS1 p46 and p44a expression vectors using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 24\u00a0h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100, washed with PBS, and blocked with 5% normal donkey serum and 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Subsequently, cells were incubated with anti-58\u00a0K Golgi mouse monoclonal (58\u00a0K-9, Abcam) and anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal (Sigma) primary antibodies. They were then incubated with secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit IgG donkey polyclonal with Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and anti-mouse IgG donkey polyclonal with Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following nuclear staining with hoechst33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), fluorescent images were acquired with an SP8 confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzler, Germany); colocalization was quantified using Fiji [].\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2 infection\n\nSARS-CoV-2 isolate (SARS-CoV-2/Hu/DP/Kng/19\u2013027), kindly provided by the Kanagawa Prefectural Institute of Public Health, was propagated in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells [], which was used as the virus stock after clarification of cell debris. Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells were pre-treated with 10\u00a0\u03bcM CaNDY or 0.1% DMSO for 24\u00a0h, infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, and maintained in the presence of 10\u00a0\u03bcM CaNDY or 0.1% DMSO. OAS1 p44a-overexpressing Calu-3 and parental Calu-3 cells were infected under the same condition without compound treatment. Virus titers were determined using the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) with VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells at 48\u00a0h post-infection (pi).\n\nRNA was also extracted from Calu-3 cells treated with CaNDY or DMSO and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 1.0 for 24\u00a0h. Titration assays were conducted with six biological replicates for Calu-3 under CaNDY treatment, three for Caco-2 under CaNDY treatment, and three for Calu-3 stably overexpressing OAS1 p44a. All experiments with SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a biosafety level 3 containment laboratory at the Institute for Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University.\n\n\nRNA degradation analysis\n\nRNA samples were diluted with RNase-free ultrapure water to 200\u00a0ng/\u03bcL. The quality of the diluted RNA samples was evaluated using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Three biological replicates from independent cell cultures were prepared for DMSO and CaNDY treatments for the infected cells, respectively. Total RNA from transcriptome analysis represented the uninfected control. The gel-like image produced by the 2100 Bioanalyzer was visualized using 2100 Expert Software (ver. B.02.11, Agilent Technologies) in pseudo colors with default settings. For detailed analyses, the migration time and fluorescence unit data were extracted in CSV format aligned with the sample data. Next, the fluorescence unit values were normalized to an RNA concentration of 300\u00a0ng/\u03bcL. The data between 43.3\u00a0s and 48.0\u00a0s of the migration time were selected as cleaved RNA products and between 49.9\u00a0s and 51.4\u00a0s as the 28S rRNA. The sums of the fluorescence unit values were used for further analysis. The values were scaled to the mean values of DMSO samples to construct bar plots.\n\n\nRT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR\n\nThe total RNA extracted from cultured cells was reverse transcribed using PrimeScript RTase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) with random hexamers; the products were amplified with ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio) or KOD one (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) with target-specific primer sets (Additional file : Table S5). The RT-PCR products were detected using the ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad); subsequent analysis was performed using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). RT-PCR was conducted in three technical replicates per sample. Real-time RT-PCR was conducted for SRSF6 (Hs00740177_g1, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and ACTB (Hs01060665_g1, Thermo Fisher Scientific), using the TaqMan PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for RT products. Real-time RT-PCR signals were detected using the Step One Plus real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed for the relative expression level of SRSF6 using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method.\n\n\nGene Set Enrichment Analysis\n\nFor Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), a software version 4.4.3 [] and a database; the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) version 7.4 were used. RNA-seq profiles were obtained from SARS-Cov-2-infected Calu-3 cells. Target samples (n\u2009=\u20093) were pre-treated with CaNDY, and control samples (n\u2009=\u20093) were not pre-treated. Genes were discarded from this analysis when the TPM value was\u2009<\u20091.0. For ranking the genes, \u201cDiff_of_Classes\u201d method was used.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nAdditional file 1: Fig. S1. Genotyping of the rs10774671 SNP.

This study developed a novel virtual NGS-based long read method (ViLR) and preliminarily evaluated its clinical feasibility of breakpoint characterization and direct SNP haplotyping for de novo chromosomal structural rearrangements (CSR).MethodsA total of 10 families with de novo CSR risk were enrolled in this study for ViLR analysis. In contrast to LRS, ViLR is a virtual long read solution that used the same barcoded labeling and assembly of different long gDNAs differently barcoded. Notably, ViLR could generate an average fragment length of over 30 Kb, with an N50 block size of up to 16\u00a0Mb in a single assay, allowing to achieve accurate breakpoint mapping and direct carrier\u2019s haplotyping. An approximately 2 Mbp region flanking upstream and downstream of each breakpoint was selected for informative SNP collection. Embryo haplotype determination was based on the established carriers\u2019 haplotypes after whole genome amplification and sequencing. To confirm PGT-SR results, we performed prenatal genetic diagnosis.ResultsThis study achieved an average mapping rate of 99.5%, >\u200990% coverage depth (>\u200910X), an average number of effective barcode (>\u20095\u00a0kb length) counts of 11,000,000 and an average fragment length of 40\u00a0kb, which generated sufficient informative SNPs for breakpoint characterization and haplotype phasing. ViLR analysis of 10 de novo PGT-SR carriers precisely identified breakpoints and haplotypes. Seven families obtained 18 euploid embryos, in which 10 were euploid/normal embryos, 7 were euploid/balanced carrier embryos, and the remaining one unknown was due to homologous recombination of the breakpoint region. Prenatal genetic diagnosis was performed for four women, and the outcomes coincided with the results from embryo PGT-SR. At the time of writing this paper, four healthy babies had been delivered uneventfully.ConclusionHere, we demonstrated the clinical potential of ViLR as a novel solution for breakpoint identification and direct SNP haplotyping in de novo PGT-SR families without proband involvement.Clinical trial numberNot applicable.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12958-025-01366-3.", "good_summary": "This study presents ViLR, a novel virtual next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based long-link read method designed for preimplantation genetic testing for structural rearrangements (PGT-SR) in de novo chromosomal structural rearrangement (CSR) carriers without available familial or proband data. CSR, including balanced translocations (BT) and inversions, are common causes of infertility and miscarriage, but traditional haplotyping methods require affected family members, limiting clinical application when such samples are unavailable. ViLR uses barcoded labeling to generate long DNA fragments (>30 kb) sequenced by NGS, enabling precise breakpoint identification and direct SNP haplotyping of carriers. \n\nIn a prospective study, 10 families (8 BT, 2 inversions) underwent ViLR analysis on peripheral blood DNA to characterize breakpoints and construct haplotypes, which were then applied to genotype 41 biopsied blastocysts obtained via ICSI. Results showed an average mapping rate of 99.5%, >90% coverage depth, and an assembled N50 fragment size of up to 16 Mb, yielding sufficient informative SNPs for accurate haplotype phasing. Of the embryos analyzed, 18 were euploid (10 normal, 7 balanced carriers), and seven families successfully underwent embryo transfer. Four pregnancies were confirmed normal by prenatal diagnosis, and four healthy babies were delivered. \n\nCompared to third-generation long read sequencing (LRS), ViLR offers a cost-effective alternative with comparable accuracy, overcoming limitations of linked short-read NGS (such as insufficient fragment length) and high LRS costs. While ViLR cannot detect some repeats, Robertsonian translocations, or centromeric regions, it effectively phases breakpoints and determines embryo genotypes in de novo CSR carriers, facilitating clinical decision-making. The study highlights ViLR\u2019s potential for broad clinical PGT-SR application in contexts lacking familial genetic data, although larger studies are necessary to validate and extend these findings.", "medium_summary": "This study presents ViLR, a novel virtual NGS-based long-link read method developed to identify breakpoints and perform SNP haplotyping in carriers of de novo chromosomal structural rearrangements (CSRs) such as balanced translocations (BT) and inversions. The research involved 10 infertile Chinese families without proband samples, where traditional family-based haplotyping is challenging. ViLR uses barcoded long genomic DNA fragments, averaging over 30 Kb, to assemble and map reads for breakpoint characterization and direct parental haplotype phasing.\n\nAmong the 10 carriers, 8 had balanced translocations and 2 had inversions. ViLR successfully identified 19 breakpoints, mostly within introns disrupting genes like CRIM1 and ADAMTS17. Embryos from these families were biopsied and sequenced after whole genome amplification. Using ViLR phased haplotypes, 41 blastocysts were analyzed, resulting in 18 euploid embryos (10 normal and 7 balanced carriers). Selected embryos were transferred with subsequent prenatal diagnosis confirming PGT-SR accuracy in most cases, and four healthy babies were born.\n\nViLR offers a cost-effective alternative to third-generation long read sequencing by using linked short-read NGS technology with high coverage and quality (>90% at Q30). However, ViLR cannot detect Robertsonian translocations or rearrangements in satellite regions, as seen in a chromosome 14 breakpoint missed in one case. Limitations include reliance on high molecular weight DNA and potential issues with homologous recombination near breakpoints. Despite these, ViLR presents a promising method for preimplantation genetic testing in de novo CSR carriers lacking family reference samples.", "bad_summary": "This study investigated 20 families with balanced translocations (BT) and inversions using standard fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for genetic diagnosis in assisted reproductive technology (ART). The authors noted that about 1% of all couples undergoing ART are carriers of chromosomal abnormalities, but did not specify the exact ratio of inversions. The research focused on using traditional next-generation sequencing (NGS) with short reads to map the breakpoints, which were located mainly in exonic regions of genes such as CRIM1 and ADAMTS17.\n\nThey introduced an innovative technique called Virtual Long Read Sequencing (VLRS), which uses Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) to generate long reads over 50 Kb. This method was tested on 12 pedigrees and required at least 10 embryos per family for accurate haplotype phasing. The process involved blastocyst biopsies followed by whole genome amplification (WGA) using PCR, though they encountered a high allelic dropout (ADO) rate of around 20%, which limited analysis.\n\nResults showed that out of 35 embryos analyzed, 15 were normal, while 10 were unbalanced carriers. The study reported precise breakpoint detection on chromosomes 2 and 15, but gene disruptions were mainly in non-coding regions. Only three healthy babies were born after embryo transfer, with one miscarriage at 10 weeks due to unrelated causes.\n\nThe study concluded that while VLRS improves breakpoint identification, it is expensive and requires multiple embryos, making it less feasible for clinical use without family samples. They suggested further improvements are needed to reduce errors and cost.", "original_text": "\nBackground\n\nBalanced translocation (BT) and inversion, both considered chromosomal structural rearrangements (CSR), are common genetic causes for assisted reproductive technology (ART) [, ]. A recent retrospective study indicated that the overall prevalence of chromosome aberrations was 2.04% in 17,054 Chinese infertile patients, of which 0.97% were BT carriers and 0.09% had inversions []. Carriers with BT or inversion are usually phenotypically normal, but prone to produce imbalanced gametes, resulting in recurrent spontaneous abortions, implantation failure, infertility, or fetal defects [, ]. Preimplantation genetic testing for structural rearrangements (PGT-SR) allows selecting disease-free embryos to transfer in CSR carriers []. Traditionally, embryo diagnosis could be achieved via next-generation sequencing (NGS) or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray-based genome-wide haplotyping relying on an affected proband or other inherited relatives in the family [\u2013], which might be a great challenge for de novo PGT-SR pedigrees without available family samples.\n\nAlthough the percentage of de novo CSR carriers in the general population or infertile couples is so far unreported, the actual carrier burden may be underestimated as individuals with incomplete families are usually managed as de novo genotypes in practical clinical PGT-SR. However, the informative SNPs for direct carrier haplotyping could be insufficient when using traditional linked short-read NGS technology. Thus, optimized NGS-based strategies for direct independent embryo testing, such as whole genome sequencing (WGS) based on parent-embryo haplotypes [], low depth WGS-based comprehensive PGT [], or GENType [], have been recently implemented to establish a reference haplotype. However, these techniques are limited by the high number of embryos needed to achieve an accurate haplotype. According to Ou\u2019s study, having an affected embryo that allows haplotype phasing was a matter of probability. Even with 8 embryos, there was still a 10% chance that no reference embryos were available []. An impaired ovarian reserve or diminished sperm quality may decrease the available blastocysts, or the reference embryo could not be accessible due to failed direct genotyping. In addition, PCR errors or allelic dropout (ADO) are unavoidable during whole genome amplification (WGA) of direct embryo detection.\n\nCurrently, third-generation long read sequencing (LRS) technologies, mainly from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), have the unique advantage of \u2265\u200910\u00a0kb long readings to obtain a direct accurate haplotype in CSR families. For instance, the PacBio platform could provide a useful set of SNPs in PGT-SR and preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disease (PGT-M) test designs []. Similarly, previous studies demonstrated the utility of ONT\u2019s platform in haplotyping inversion and BT carriers [, ]. Moreover, Tsuiko proposed that LRS application could help with preclinical haplotype imputation of couples with de novo variants []. Nevertheless, the high sequencing cost limits extensive clinical applicability of LRS. For instance, a single human genome sequencing run (30\u00d7 depth) using LRS costs $1,000\u20132,000, generally 5\u201310 times higher than with linked short-read NGS []. Therefore, an efficient and cost-effective NGS-based detection platform is needed for direct haplotyping in single de novo carriers without a proband.\n\nWe developed a novel virtual NGS-based long-link read method (ViLR) for an average fragment length of over 30 Kb per molecule, based on the same barcoded labeling. Assembly and alignment of different long gDNAs with different barcodes after sequencing produced sufficient informative SNPs for mapping to the reference genome. We collected a total of 10 de novo PGT-SR pedigrees (8 BTs and 2 inversions) in this prospective design. Each carrier underwent ViLR analysis for breakpoint characterization and direct SNP haplotyping. Linkage analysis and embryo genotype identification were based on the established carriers\u2019 haplotypes. Overall, our study demonstrated the clinical feasibility and applied potential of ViLR for de novo PGT-SR pedigrees without familial involvement.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nSample information\n\nA total of 10 families with CSR risk were collected and subjected to intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and PGT-SR at the Affiliated Women and Children\u2019s Hospital of Ningbo University. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and this study was approved by the IRB of the Affiliated Women and Children\u2019s Hospital of Ningbo University (No. EC2020-048). The study adhered to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2013.\n\nIn these families, one of the couples were BT or inversion carriers, whose chromosomal rearrangements were primarily determined by G-banded karyotyping (KT) and diagnosed as de novo carriers after parental KT validation and paternity testing. The description of karyotypes referred to an International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature 2024 []. No probands (an affected offspring with genetic abnormalities already presented in the family) were found in 10 families. Chromosomal breakpoints and genetic haplotypings were further analyzed with ViLR, instead of traditional familial SNP haplotyping. The carriers\u2019 genetic information, including KT description, breakpoints, implantation decision-making and pregnancy outcome, are displayed in Table\u00a0. Nine families obtained their embryos through ICSI, and blastocysts were biopsied to screen for the optimal embryo for implantation. The embryos\u2019 genetic information, such as haplotype, presence of chromosomal aberrations, which embryo to select, as well as the cytogenetic result of amniotic fluid, are shown in Table\u00a0.\n\nGenetic information of carriers examined with ViLR\n\nchr2: 36,702,101;\n\nchr15: 100,682,799\n\nCRIM1: intron5;\n\nADAMTS17: intron10\n\nchr1: 235,334,249;\n\nchr7: 77,004,459\n\nARID4B: intron23;\n\nGSAP: intron10\n\nchr3: 132,423,676;\n\nchr22: 20,655,812\n\nNPHP3: intron8;\n\nFAM230J: intron1\n\nchr6: 42,996,416;\n\nchr13: undetectable\n\nRRP36: intron6;\n\nundetectable\n\nchr8: 3,146,675;\n\nchr17: 74,040,722\n\nCSMD1: intron25;\n\nSRP68: intron11\n\nchr7: 33,669,203;\n\nchr7: 86,843,221\n\nBBS9: intron22;\n\nTMEM243: intron2\n\nchr1: 176,251,882;\n\nchr18: 58,488,969\n\nCOP1-PAPPA2 (intergenic);\n\nMC4R-CDH29 (intergenic)\n\nchr1: 90,088,859;\n\nchr11: 33,317,308\n\nLRRC8B-LRRC8C-DT (intergenic);\n\nHIPK3: intron2\n\nchr7: 23,030,769;\n\nchr22: 18,976,664\n\nFAM126A: intron1;\n\nDGCR5: intron2\n\nchr20: 6,582,577;\n\nchr20: 31,663,698\n\nCASC20-LINC01713\n\n(intergenic);\n\nBPIFB3-BPIFB4 (intergenic)\n\nGenetic information of biopsied blastocysts\n\ndel(mosaic)(20)(p13p11.23)(67%);\n\ndel(mosaic)(X)(q21.2q28)(34%)\n\ndup(8)(p23.3p23.2); del(17)(q25.1q25.3);\n\ndel(mosaic)(14)(q11.2q32.32)(30%)\n\n+(mosaic)(18)(42%); +(mosaic)(22)(41%);\n\n+(mosaic)(X)(36%)\n\n*Aneuploidy of the short arm of chr13 could not be ruled out\n\n\nLong gDNA treatment and sequencing\n\nHigh molecular weight (HMW) gDNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood by Nanobind HMW DNA Extraction-Mammalian Whole Blood kit (Circulomics, USA). The concentration was measured by the Qubit\u2122 dsDNA High Sensitivity (HS) Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA); the qualified gDNA concentration was usually\u2009\u2265\u200910 ng/\u00b5L. A total of 10 ng gDNA was used for library construction.\n\nBriefly, a gDNA library was constructed by adding sample labels, barcoded beads, adapters and through PCR amplification. Initially, long gDNAs were randomly inserted by sample label (through a transposome carried with the transposon). Each barcoded bead was pre-marked with around 400,000 identical DNA tags. The complementary oligo sequences on both transposons and barcoded beads could facilitate bilateral connection through a ligase. Eventually, a long gDNA was bound with tag-marked barcoded beads; thus, reads from one long gDNA were marked with the same tags and different long gDNAs with different tags. Thereafter, spare oligos were digested, the transposome deactivated, and adapters added. Short DNA fragments with the same tags were derived from a long DNA molecule. Finally, the libraries were built by PCR amplification (Fig.\u00a0).\n\nOverview of ViLR workup strategy. ViLR is a novel virtual NGS-based long-link read method, firstly developed for de novo PGT-SR carriers\u2019 haplotype phasing without a proband. (1) Specifical sample and barcoded bead labeling. First, HMW gDNAs were extracted from de novo chromosomal rearrangement carriers. Long gDNAs were inserted by transposome-transposon, and linked with tags-marked barcoded beads. After inactivating the transposome and adding the adapters, short DNA fragments with the same tags were generated. Finally, libraries were built by PCR amplification. (2) Breakpoint identification and direct SNP haplotyping of carriers. After sequencing, a long read gDNA with the same tags could be assembled; different long read molecules differently tagged were simultaneously generated and aligned for mapping to the reference genome. Sufficient informative SNPs were collected for breakpoint characterization and haplotype phasing. (3) Haplotype determination of embryos. Blastocysts were subjected to biopsy and WGA. After genome library construction, sequencing and SNP calling, embryonic haplotypes could be directly identified based on the established carriers\u2019 haplotype phasing\n\nThe concentration and fragment size of libraries were quantified using the Qubit\u2122 dsDNA HS Assay Kit and 2100 High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent, United States). The concentration of qualified libraries should be \u2265\u20092.6 ng/\u00b5L, and the fragment size distributed across 200\u20132000\u00a0bp. A MGI-2000 sequencer (MGI Tech Co., Ltd., ShenZhen, China) was used for genome sequencing. The data generated from all samples is shown in Supplementary Tables \u2013.\n\n\nCarriers\u2019 chromosomal breakpoints confirmation\n\nRaw sequencing FASTQ files were trimmed by removing DNA molecular tag sequences and the tag information embedded onto read names using a predefined table. We filtered low quality reads with adaptors or bases with quality Q10\u2009\u2265\u200910%. The BWA software (version 0.7.17-r1188) was used to align the preprocessed files against the reference genome (GRCh37/hg19), resulting in the generation of BAM files containing aligned reads. Post-alignment, PCR deduplication and base quality score recalibration were performed using the GATK software (v4.1.4.0-local), and mutations were analyzed to produce single nucleotide variant vcf files. Smoove software (version 0.2.8) was employed to determine breakpoints and genotype information of structural variants (SVs). The diagram of reads alignment around the breakpoint regions is displayed in Supplementary Tables \u2013.\n\n\nCarriers\u2019 haplotype phasing without a proband\n\nHapCut2 software (v1.3.1) was used for assembling and haplotyping target SV chromosomes. Reads inferred SV breakpoints were used to identify SV-carrying haplotypes by phased tags of read names from Hapcut2 results. To distinguish paternal and maternal alleles, informative SNPs were selected based on parental genotypes, focusing on heterozygous SNPs in the carrier parent and homozygous SNPs in the other parent.\n\n\nICSI and trophectoderm biopsy\n\nAll these families received ART due to SV risk. To integrate mature oocytes, fertilization was completed by ICSI. Two pronuclei were considered normal after 16\u201318\u00a0h, and embryos were cultured until \u2265\u20094 cells on D3. Blastocysts with morphology\u2009\u2265\u20093BC according to the Gardner and Schoolcraft grading system were subjected to trophectoderm biopsy at D5 or D6. A total of 3\u20135 cells were obtained from each blastocyst and added to 2 \u00b5L of phosphate-buffered saline. The preparations were frozen at -20\u00baC and immediately vitrified.\n\n\nSequencing and genotypes identification for embryos\n\nEmbryonic samples were processed by a REPLI-g Single Cell Kit (150345, QIAGEN, Germany) for multiple displacement amplification (MDA)-based WGA according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. An integrated haplotyping-based approach involving DNA library construction, sequencing and data analysis was applied for embryo PGT []. The output of each sample was \u2265\u20098 GB and had a Q30\u2009>\u200980%.\n\nThe embryonic sequencing data were aligned to human reference genome (National Center for Biotechnology Information hg19 version) via BWA (Burrows-Wheeler-Alignment Tool, http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). GATK (Genome Analysis Tool Kit, http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) was used to identify SNPs in the genome. Then the SNP sites of the embryo could be used for embryo haplotype analysis. An approximately 1 Mbp region flanking upstream and downstream of each breakpoint was selected for ADO loci and total phasing SNP loci calculating, and the ratio of two values was defined as ADO rate. Based on informative SNPs from carriers\u2019 haplotypes, structural rearrangements in the embryos\u2019 chromosomes were identified by SNP haplotype analysis. Embryos exhibiting unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements based on copy number variation were excluded from SNP haplotype analysis. Balanced embryos exhibiting phased SNPs consistent with SV-carrier haplotypes were diagnosed as euploid/balanced carrier embryos, while the others were classified as euploid/normal embryos.\n\n\nEmbryo transfer and prenatal diagnosis\n\nOnly euploid/normal and euploid/balanced embryos were considered as available embryos for transplantation. Combined with embryo morphology results, one optimal embryo was selected to transferred into the uterus (Table\u00a0). Except for Pedigree PSJ23012 and PSJ24002, other five transplantable families were implanted with euploid/normal embryos. Amniocentesis was performed at week 19 of gestation. KT and chromosomal microarray analysis of amniotic fluid samples were diagnosed to confirm PGT-SR results.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nGenetic description of 10\n\nFrom June 2022 to January 2024, a total of 10 families with de novo chromosomal rearrangements requesting PGT-SR were enrolled in this prospective study. The genetic abnormalities of 10 carriers had been previously determined by conventional KT analysis. Only two females carried chromosomal pericentric inversions, while the remaining eight carriers were BTs. Moreover, as no probands or other relatives were available, ViLR analysis was used for breakpoint identification and direct SNP haplotyping of 10 carriers. A total of 19 breakpoints were identified, of which 14 were located within intragenic intron regions, and five were intergenic. Regarding the clinical PGT-SR phase, seven families obtained available embryos for transplantation, four passed prenatal diagnosis, and successfully delivered healthy babies (Table\u00a0).\n\n\nBreakpoint identification and direct SNP haplotyping with ViLR analysis\n\nAn overview of ViLR is shown in Fig.\u00a0. The genome sequencing data in this study achieved an average mapping rate of 99.5%, >\u200990% coverage depth (>\u200910X), an average number of effective barcode (>\u20095\u00a0kb length) counts of 11,000,000 and an average fragment length of 40\u00a0kb (Supplementary Table ), which generated sufficient informative SNPs for subsequent breakpoint characterization and haplotype phasing.\n\nAs shown in the PSJ22007 carrier, breakpoint locations and chromosome translocations could be precisely detected by ligation of various different barcodes and link read alignment to the reference (Fig.\u00a0A-B). Figure\u00a0C displays the breakpoints of 2p21(36,702,101) and 15q26.1(100,682,799), as well as the chromosome structural rearrangements of t(2;15)(p21;q26.1), all further confirmed through Gap-PCR, gel electrophoresis, and Sanger sequencing (Fig.\u00a0D-E). Both breakpoints were found within the introns of CRIM1 and ADAMTS17, thus disrupting gene structure (Table\u00a0). The rearranged chromosome diagrams of other nine carriers are shown in Supplementary Figs.\u00a0\u2013, and the involved disrupted genes are presented in Table\u00a0. These results indicate the potential of ViLR for exact breakpoint identification.\n\nDiagram of reads config and alignment at the breakpoint regions of PSJ22007 carrier. a\u2013f represent different barcoded beads.

(A) Out of 40 CNV detected embryos, 22 were aneuploid (dark blue), 18 were euploid (dark pink), in which 10 were euploid/normal embryos (light pink), 7 were euploid/balanced carrier embryos (light yellow), and the remaining one unknown (light blue); (B) Haplotype diagram flanking breakpoint regions of t(2;15)(p21;q26.1) in pedigree PSJ22007.

Yellow and green indicate the maternal normal single chains. PSJ22007_E1 exhibited the carrier chain color in the effective diploid region near the breakpoints of chr2 and chr15, that was translocation carrier embryo.

The red arrow indicates the breakpoint of 2p21(36,702,101), and the green arrow that of 15q26.1(100,682,799)\n\nAn approximately 2 Mbp region flanking upstream and downstream of each breakpoint was selected for informative SNP collection (Supplementary Tables \u2013). Interestingly, the chr13 breakpoint in the PSJ23002 carrier was within a short-arm satellite, a region not detected by ViLR, as this is one of the linked short-read NGS\u2019 inherent limitations; thus, the haplotype of this breakpoint region was referred to the downstream SNP loci (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0B). The remaining nine carriers all obtained successful haplotype phasing based on both upstream and downstream informative SNP loci per breakpoint (Fig.\u00a0C, Supplementary Figs.\u00a0\u2013).\n\n\nEmbryo haplotype determination by ViLR\n\nAfter preclinical carrier\u2019s haplotyping, Pedigree PSJ23021 had not yet received ovarian stimulation. Pedigree PSJ22019 and PSJ23002 both underwent two in vitro fertilization cycles, while other seven families only underwent one cycle. A total of 41 blastocysts were subjected to biopsy and WGA. After genome library construction, sequencing and linkage analysis, the haplotype and chromosome structural rearrangements in each embryo could be directly identified based on the established carriers\u2019 haplotypes (Fig.\u00a0; Table\u00a0). High-quality control of sequencing data was performed for all embryos (Supplementary Table ). The average ADO rate of all balanced embryos was only about 6.07%, which indicated that as many informative SNP loci as possible could be obtained on each side of the breakpoint per family for embryo haplotype determination.\n\nEach family with available embryos underwent a single embryo transplantation to date. Out of 40 CNV detected embryos, 18 were euploid, in which 10 were euploid/normal embryos, 7 were euploid/balanced carrier embryos, and the remaining one unknown due to homologous recombination of the breakpoint region (Fig.\u00a0A). Haplotype analysis of pedigree PSJ22007 indicated that E1 was a translocation carrier embryo (Fig.\u00a0B), whose breakpoints were further confirmed through traditional testings (Fig.\u00a0D-E). E2 and E3 both harbored normal haplotypes, thus producing a negative result in breakpoint verification (Fig.\u00a0D). However, E1 was a mosaic embryo and E2 had a trisomy 4; thus, only embryo E3 was suitable for transplantation ( Fig.\u00a0A).\n\nEmbryonic CNV results and prenatal cytogenetic results of pedigree PSJ22007. (A) CNV results of embryos. PSJ22007_E1 was a mosaic embryo involving chr20 and chrX, PSJ22007_E2 had Trisomy 4, and only PSJ22007_E3 was an euploid embryo. Detailed CNVs results are shown in Table\u00a0; (B) CMA result of prenatal amniocytes; (C) KT result of the PSJ22007 male carrier. The red arrow indicates the translocation chromatid of chr2 and chr15; (D) KT result of PSJ22007 prenatal amniocytes\n\n\nClinical outcomes of PGT-SR\n\nThanks to successful preclinical ViLR application, one optimal embryo was finally selected and transplanted in each of the seven families (Table\u00a0). Four pedigrees of PSJ22007, PSJ23008, PSJ23011 and PSJ23012 had finished amniocentesis, and obtained normal cytogenetic results, concordant with ViLR analysis data (Fig.\u00a0B and D, Supplementary Figs.\u00a0\u2013). Unfortunately, Pedigree PSJ23019 lost their baby at seven weeks of gestational age. To exclude lethal monogenic disorders or chromosome anomalies, enhanced whole exome sequencing combined with copy number variation (CNV) detection was performed in abortive villi, but no genetic causes were identified. At the time of writing this manuscript, four women had received prenatal diagnosis, each of them eventually delivered a healthy baby with normal phenotypes.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nPGT-SR has been widely regarded as a valuable technology to provide diagnosis and genetic counsel for CSR couples [, ]. CSR families could generally have a good clinical outcome after euploid/normal or euploid/balanced embryo transfer, however, multiple complex factors affecting chromosome segregation during the process of mitosis and meiosis, would limit the number of embryos available for transfer. A retrospective study by Ogur et al. in 300 PGT-SR couples discovered that the most important factors that affect segregations and the proportion of transferable embryos were chromosomal rearrangement type and sex []. Another study comparing three different PGT-SRs using the NGS method demonstrated that the percentage of unbalanced blastocysts was significantly higher in reciprocal translocation than in inversion and Robertsonian translocation carriers (64.31% vs. 28.05% vs. 37.02%) []. Besides, DNA elimination, centromeric and centromere-proximal features, chromosome size and location, etc., all could increase non-random chromosome segregation errors [, ], further exacerbating fertility risks. In other words, unblanced chromosomal rearrangement-induced abnormal embryonic development, abortion, stillbirth, and even severe birth defects will be unavoidable if no any interventions are adopted for carriers.\n\nThe application of haplotyping for embryonic PGT-SR, rather than direct embryo detection, makes a valuable technological contribution to ART. In traditional PGT phase, short read dependent haplotype construction requires simultaneous detection of samples from other family members or diseased offspring other than husband and wife, in order to evaluate whether embryos inherit parental pathogenic chains. In fact, many families do not have a proband sample or complete family members, so haplotype analysis without a proband is needed. Here in our study, ViLR provides an effective solution for these specific couples, which analysis is based on NGS platform, and does not require a proband. Its virtual long read capacity can be effectively applied for breakpoint identification and direct SNP haplotyping in de novo PGT-SR carriers.\n\nAlthough two different NGS-based linked-read solutions, respectively named HLRS [] and Phbol-seq [], have been recently reported for proband-independent carrier\u2019s haplotyping in preclinical PGT-M, only two or three families were separately included, and their use for clinical PGT-SR is insufficient. In this study, we accurately detected the breakpoints in 10 de novo CSR carriers using ViLR, which facilitated subsequent clinical PGT-SR and genetic counseling. Nine families obtained embryos via ICSI, which were sequenced and phased to determine their suitability for implantation. Among those, five euploid/normal embryos and two euploid/balanced carrier embryos were selected for transplantation. Four pedigrees already gave birth to healthy babies, and one woman from pedigree PSJ24002 continued to have uneventful pregnancy till now.\n\nCompared to traditional testing approaches, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), array comparative genomic hybridization, SNP arrays, karyomapping, etc., the linked short-read NGS has higher-resolution, higher-accuracy, low-cost [, ], and is regarded as a widely acceptable method for PGT-SR. Despite several successful applications of LRS in clinical PGT-SR owing to its unique capacity of long reads [\u2013, ], both PacBio and ONT still had their inherent limitations. According to Wenger\u2019s study, the optimization of circular consensus sequencing method could improve the accuracy of PacBio and generate highly accurate (99.8%) long HiFi reads [], which indicated Pacbio\u2019s relatively low error rate. However, Pacbio was still not recommended for long fragment assembly and carrier haplotype construction in practical scenario, because its average fragment length is only about 10-20Kb (e.g. an average length of 13.5\u00a0kb in Wenger\u2019s study), and the assembled N50 value of ~\u2009150Kb is lower than ONT (~\u2009800Kb) and ViLR (11-16\u00a0Mb). In addition, the ONT fragment length displayed a large variation, and its error rate was reported up to 5\u201315% [\u2013], thus the low base mass could lead to less informative SNPs, that was insufficient for haplotype phasing. So the argument for increased diagnostic yield of LRS remains further validated, and it is not reliable to replace the previous NGS sequencing devices.\n\nTo our knowledge, FISH could only detect specific chromosomal regions or probes, thus resulting in limited coverage, which could not comprehensively reveal the whole chromosomal SVs. Therefore, preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) cannot be simultaneously detected by FISH in PGT-SR scenario [], thus aneuploidies and mosaicisms cannot be fully excluded, which limitation could be solved by NGS technology instead. Also, the interpretation of FISH results relies on the experience and ability of the operator, whose subjectivity may lead to data inaccuracies. Furthermore, although the cost of FISH technology is relatively low, the overall cost will also increase significantly as more chromosomal regions are required to be detected. In contrast, NGS-based haplotype construction technology offers higher resolution and accuracy, and can comprehensively uncover all chromosomal SVs, including small deletions/duplications, inversions, or translocations, etc., providing more detailed information for genetic counseling and fertility planning. Additionally, NGS technology features high throughput, allowing for the processing of a large number of samples in a short period, enhancing detection efficiency. Although the initial investment and operating costs of NGS technology is higher, its long-term benefits and accuracy got priority consideration in many genetic counseling and reproductive health fields.\n\nHere, NGS-based ViLR technology provides a more comprehensive and accurate solution for PGT-SR. The mean Q30 rate of ViLR analysis is over 90%, which is comparable to the mean base quality of other NGS platform [], thus lower error was generated. A MGI-2000 sequencer (MGI Tech Co., Ltd., ShenZhen, China) was used in this study for ViLR sequencing, which indicated an extremely lower sequencing cost per gigabase (Gb) of data compared to LRS platforms (ViLR: $6/Gb, vs. Pacbio: $30/Gb, vs. Nanopore: $24/Gb) from our local investigation. In addition to the direct sequencing costs, other regional cost differences should also be considered, which influence factors mainly included regional economic levels, price index, and the prevalence of sequencing technology. For example, in highly developed regions, although sequencing technology may be more advanced, the corresponding equipment and labor costs are also higher; Instead, in some emerging or developing countries, the cost may be relatively low as sequencing technology becomes more widely available. Economies of scale also have an impact on sequencing costs. Large-scale sequencing projects tend to be more cost-effective because fixed costs (e.g., equipment acquisition, laboratory construction) can be spread over more samples, thus reducing the cost per sequencing unit. This scale plays an important role in driving the adoption of sequencing technology and reducing health care costs. Of course, indirect costs, including data interpretation, cannot be ignored. These costs, although not directly reflected in the sequencing process, are equally important to patients and health care organizations. Therefore, all relevant factors are needed to be considered comprehensively to ensure the accuracy and feasibility of medical decisions when conducting cost analysis. Furthermore, due to the more extensive clinical application of NGS, the cost-effectiveness and adoption of ViLR technology can be potentially enhanced in the future. Using the same barcoded labeling, ViLR enables sequencing longer DNA fragments with an average length of over 30 Kb, and generates an assembled N50 block size of up to 16\u00a0Mb, which indicates that ViLR can span larger chromosomal regions, detect more complex SVs across the whole genome, including complex translocations, cryptic translocations, large inversions and deletions. We did not enroll any complex rearranged cases in this prospective study, that testing performance using ViLR would be summarized in our future study.\n\nSimilar to LRS, ViLR analysis was able to generate direct informative SNP profiles phased against the breakpoints. In this study, 98% of the whole genome regions could be covered and >\u20093.8\u00a0million SNPs were obtained for carriers, facilitating more accurate haplotype construction. Similarly, for embryos, 99.8% of targeted regions were mapped and 1\u00a0million SNPs were detected, data sufficient for genome-wide linkage analysis. Also, MDA was used for WGA of embryo biopsies in our study, by which a lower ADO rate (average 6.07%) and more informative SNP loci [, , ] were achieved for embryo haplotype determination.\n\nIn our study, a total of 18 euploid embryos were obtained, of which 10 were euploid/normal embryos, 7 were euploid/balanced carrier embryos, and the remaining unknown phasing was due to homologous recombination of the breakpoint region. Homologous recombination is an important process in biology that involves the exchange and recombination of DNA. In PGT phase, homologous recombination may have a certain impact on the test results. Since a constant background recombination rate of 1\u00a0cM/Mb in human genome [], the homologous recombination near the chromosomal breakpoint cannot be excluded, which may result in inaccurate detection results in the embryos. However, analysis of sufficient effective SNP sites facilitates the identification of embryonic recombination. ViLR provides an average of more than 5 SNP loci flanking upstream and downstream of each breakpoint within an approximately 1 Mbp region, that accurate haplotyping event can effectively distinguish the recombination region. Certainly, more clinical practical verification is needed to clarify the effectiveness of ViLR technology for detection of embryonic homologous recombination, which will also provide more useful information for doctors to select better embryos for transfer.\n\nNevertheless, ViLR still had conventional linked short-read NGS\u2019s limitations for PGT-SR [, ]. It cannot detect Robertsonian translocation and high-repeat areas []. SVs near the telomer, in the centromere and satellite regions, or in GC-rich regions, cannot be detected by linked short-read NGS [, ], but could be reasonably and effectively tested by optical genome mapping [, ] or third-generation LRS [, ]. Accordingly, the SNP haplotype of the chr13 breakpoint region in the PSJ23002 carrier could not be directly detected by ViLR owing to its satellite area. Similar to LRS, a higher requirement of sample DNA quality (90% of DNA\u2009\u2265\u200910 kb & 50% of DNA\u2009>\u200930\u00a0kb) is needed for ViLR, because the length of inserted-barcode DNAs determine the detectability and precision of this method. Certainly, this requires sample conservation and transport at -20\u00baC and to avoid repeated freeze-thaw. Additionally, in ViLR analysis, heterozygous SNPs in the carrier and homozygous SNPs in the other partner were selected for informative SNP collection. Haplotype phasing could be limited when the breakpoint is within an extended region of homozygosity, which is also compromised by LRS detection []. Thus, unbalanced reference embryo could be used for haplotype linkage analysis in this particular case. Therefore, the combination of ViLR and traditional testing is necessary for targeting those specific genome sequences.\n\nAll carriers in this study were confirmed as balanced translocation or inversion carriers using peripheral karyotyping. Actually, germline mosaicism can not be entirely excluded in our cohort. The possibility of mosaicism exists, although its probability is relatively low (~\u20095%) [, ]. Germline mosaicism may be caused by multiple factors, such as gene mutation during the development of the fertilized oocyte, chromosome non-separation, germ cell fusion, etc. In addition, environmental factors (e.g. radiation, chemicals, etc.) may also affect the genetic stability of germ cells, thereby increasing the risk of germline mosaicism. However, due to the complexity and diversity of germline mosaicism, the research on its mechanism, detection methods and clinical significance is still not enough. It is difficult to construct the carrying haplotype of parents when more pathogenic variants occured in germ cells, but less existed in peripheral blood. Increasing the depth of long fragment sequencing may achieve successful haplotype. Therefore, we need to keep an open and cautious attitude towards the inaccuracy of test results caused by germline mosaicism during PGT detection, which also warrants further exploration.\n\nOverall, our prospective study using a novel ViLR platform identified precise breakpoints and achieved embryonic diagnosis for 10 de novo CSR couples. We obtained full agreement between prenatal cytogenetic results and ViLR data in four pedigrees. Further, direct SNP haplotyping via ViLR did not require proband or other familial analysis. Four healthy babies\u2019 born thus far further validates the potential of ViLR as a feasible tool for future clinical de novo PGT-SR. Of course, postnatal clinical examinations are needed to ensure the agreement between genetic diagnosis and clinical outcomes. However, given the small sample size of our study, the accuracy and testing scope of this technology require further testing in larger sample sizes and multiple centers.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nHere, we developed ViLR, a novel virtual NGS-based long read method, and demonstrated its clinical relevance for breakpoint identification and direct SNP haplotyping in 10 de novo CSR carriers. Our data provide a novel solution in de novo PGT-SR families without proband or other inheritance information available.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\n\nSupplementary Material 1\n\nSupplementary Material 1\n\nSupplementary Material 2\n\nSupplementary Material 2\n\nSupplementary Material 3\n\nSupplementary Material 3\n\nSupplementary Material 4\n\nSupplementary Material 4\n\nSupplementary Material 5\n\nSupplementary Material 5\n\nSupplementary Material 6\n\nSupplementary Material 6\n\nSupplementary Material 7\n\nSupplementary Material 7\n\nSupplementary Material 8\n\nSupplementary Material 8\n\nSupplementary Material 9\n\nSupplementary Material 9\n\nSupplementary Material 10\n\nSupplementary Material 10\n\nSupplementary Material 11\n\nSupplementary Material 11\n\nSupplementary Material 12\n\nSupplementary Material 12\n\nSupplementary Material 13\n\nSupplementary Material 13\n\nSupplementary Material 14\n\nSupplementary Material 14\n\nSupplementary Material 15\n\nSupplementary Material 15"}

SNP-630, a newly developed synthetic molecule with multiple mechanisms of action, and a mixture of two of its active metabolites (SNP-630-MS) inhibit CYP2E1 expression to prevent reactive oxygen species generation, thereby reducing the accumulation of hepatic triglycerides and lowering chemokine levels. This study investigated the SNP-630\u2019s potential to alleviate the liver injury in MASH and its efficacy in both a mouse model and patients with MASH to identify a drug candidate that targets multiple pathways implicated in MASH.MethodsSNP-630 and SNP-630-MS were separately administered to the MASH mouse model. The tolerability, safety, and efficacy of SNP-630-MS were also evaluated in 35 patients with MASH. The primary endpoint of the study was assessment of the changes in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels from baseline to week 12, while the secondary endpoints included the evaluation of liver inflammation, steatosis, and fibrosis parameters and markers.ResultsSNP-630 treatment in mice improved inflammation, liver steatosis, and fibrosis compared with that in the MASH control group. Both SNP-630 and SNP-630-MS treatments markedly reduced ALT levels, hepatic triglyceride content, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and fibrotic collagen (i.e., Col1a1, Col3a1, and Timp1) in mice. In the clinical trial, patients treated with SNP-630-MS exhibited significant improvement in ALT levels at week 12 compared with baseline levels, with no reports of severe adverse events. This improvement in ALT levels surpassed that achieved with most other MASH candidates. SNP-630-MS demonstrated potential antifibrotic effects, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the levels of fibrogenesis-related biomarkers such as CCL4, CCL5, and caspase 3. Subgroup analysis using FibroScan measurements further indicated the efficacy of SNP-630-MS in ameliorating liver fibrosis.ConclusionsSNP-630 and SNP-630-MS demonstrated favorable results in mice. SNP-630-MS showed excellent tolerability in mice and patients with MASH. Efficacy analyses indicated that SNP-630-MS improved liver steatosis and injury in patients with MASH, suggesting that SNP-630 and 630-MS are promising therapeutic options for MASH.

MASLD/MASH pathogenesis is complex, involving insulin resistance, lipid accumulation, oxidative stress\u2014primarily via cytochrome P450-2E1 (CYP2E1)\u2014inflammation, and fibrosis. Given no approved pharmacotherapies, targeting CYP2E1 and multiple pathogenic pathways holds promise.\n\nIn vitro, SNP-630 metabolized into four active compounds, two combined as SNP-630-MS. In high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse models of MASH, oral SNP-630 and SNP-630-MS significantly inhibited CYP2E1 activity and expression, reduced hepatic triglycerides, cholesterol, inflammation markers, liver injury (ALT), steatosis, and fibrosis, with histological improvements and decreased expression of fibrotic genes (Col1a1, Col3a1, Timp1). Both compounds were safe with no adverse findings in long-term mouse studies.\n\nA phase 2 open-label clinical trial in MASH patients (n=35 completers) showed dose-dependent reductions in serum ALT, AST, lactate dehydrogenase, and hepatic fat content (MRI-PDFF), alongside improved glycemic control and decreased fibrogenic biomarkers (CCL4, CCL5). Liver stiffness significantly decreased in patients with severe fibrosis. The treatment was well tolerated with only mild, unrelated adverse events.\n\nThe study supports SNP-630 and its metabolites\u2019 multifaceted actions: inhibiting CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress, modulating lipid metabolism, inflammation, immune cell activation, and possibly improving gut barrier function. Limitations include lack of placebo control, liver biopsies, and double-blind design. Overall, SNP-630-MS shows promise as a safe, effective oral therapy for MASH, warranting further randomized placebo-controlled trials with histological endpoints.", "medium_summary": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), also known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is an advanced stage of liver disease involving lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. It can progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer, affecting nearly one-third of adults by 2030. This study evaluated SNP-630, a new synthetic molecule and its active metabolites SNP-630-MS, as potential treatments for MASH.\n\nSNP-630 and SNP-630-MS were shown to inhibit CYP2E1, an enzyme that promotes oxidative stress and liver injury in MASH, in mouse models fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Treatment with SNP-630 reduced CYP2E1 protein levels, hepatic lipid accumulation (triglycerides and cholesterol), inflammation, and fibrosis compared to controls. Histopathological analyses showed decreased fat droplets and liver ballooning with SNP-630 treatment. SNP-630-MS similarly reduced liver fat, ALT levels, and fibrosis-related gene expression in HFD-fed mice.\n\nA 12-week open-label clinical trial of SNP-630-MS in patients with MASH demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in serum ALT, a marker of liver inflammation, and improvements in liver fat as measured by MRI-PDFF, although decreases in the high-dose group were less consistent. SNP-630-MS also improved glycemic control and reduced fibrosis markers, including CCL5 and FibroScan liver stiffness in patients with advanced fibrosis. The treatment was generally safe with no serious adverse events reported.\n\nOverall, SNP-630 and its metabolites show promise for treating MASH by targeting multiple pathways including CYP2E1 inhibition, lipogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis. However, the trial lacked a placebo group and liver biopsy confirmation. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings and clarify long-term efficacy.", "bad_summary": "This study investigated the effects of a compound called SNP-630 on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Researchers tested SNP-630 and its metabolites in both human and mouse models but mainly focused on its influence on the SNP rs1234567, which is strongly linked to liver disease. The compound was given to mice on a low-fat diet for 10 weeks, and surprisingly, no significant changes in liver fat or inflammation were observed. They used western blotting to measure protein expression but mistakenly analyzed kidney tissue instead of liver. In humans, a phase 2 trial included about 50 patients, but the study lacked a control group and did not use MRI to assess liver fat content.\n\nThe main outcome was reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels rather than ALT, which is more relevant for MASH. The trial reported minor side effects like headaches and rash, with two patients dropping out due to severe adverse events. Although SNP-630 inhibited the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 in vitro, which is unrelated to MASH, its in vivo effects on CYP2E1 were not significant. The authors claimed improvements in liver stiffness using FibroScan, but this measurement was only done in three patients and did not reach statistical significance. The study did not evaluate important fibrogenic gene expressions such as Col1a2 and Acta1, which are crucial for understanding fibrosis progression.\n\nOverall, the study\u2019s findings are unreliable due to methodological errors and incomplete data, and SNP-630\u2019s potential as a treatment for MASH remains unclear.", "original_text": "\nBackground\n\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), also known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is an advanced stage of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterized by the accumulation of lipids in liver cells along with inflammation and subsequent fibrosis []. MASH can progress to severe conditions such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, posing life-threatening risks. It has been projected that by 2030, the prevalence of MASLD among adults will reach 33.5% []. Despite numerous studies conducted to understand the causes of MASLD, no approved pharmacotherapies are currently available [, ]. Consequently, there remains an urgent need to identify potential molecular targets for effective treatment by investigating the underlying mechanisms involved in the progression of MASH.\n\nThe underlying molecular pathogenesis of MASLD/MASH is complex and has been considered a \u201cmultiple-hit\u201d process, which involves multiple parallel factors acting synergistically on the liver and leading to the development or progression of the disease []. Therefore, evolving therapeutic targets for MASH has been categorized into four major groups: (1) metabolic targets that reduce insulin resistance, inhibit key enzymes involved in de novo lipogenesis (DNL), or enhance mitochondrial fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation [, ]; (2) inflammation targets that focus on blocking inflammatory cell infiltration (i.e., macrophage and CD8 T lymphocyte), suppressing inflammatory pathways (i.e., blocking Toll-like receptor 4 or TLR4 signaling), preventing oxidative damage induced by ER stress, or inhibiting hepatocyte cell death [\u2013]; (3) gut-liver axis targets that involve modulating the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, modifying the gut microbiome or lowering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) level []; and (4) anti-fibrotic targets that directly act on hepatic stellate cells, reduce collagen synthesis, assembly and deposition, or enhance fibrolysis in the liver [\u2013]. Given the multifaceted nature of MASH progression, targeting a single pathway or molecule may not be sufficient [\u2013]. There is a growing interest in exploring combination therapies that can simultaneously address different targets involved in the underlying pathogenesis of the disease.\n\nOne of the key events in the development of MASLD is insulin resistance, which increases hepatic DNL and impairs the inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis. Together with elevated free fatty acid (FFA) levels in serum, the accumulation of FFA within the hepatocyte increases, which results in steatosis. Ongoing accumulation of FFA leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which induce excessive oxidative stress [, ].\n\nOxidative stress is a major contributor to liver injury and the progression of MASLD, primarily driven by the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through cytochrome P450-2E1 (CYP2E1) mainly in the ER and less in mitochondria [\u2013]. CYP2E1, an enzyme responsible for fatty acid omega-oxidation, plays a significant role in promoting oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance and has been identified as a critical factor in the development of MASH. Increased levels of CYP2E1 have been observed in patients with steatosis and MASH, particularly in the centrilobular region, which corresponds to the site of maximum hepatocellular injury in MASH. CYP2E1 levels are also elevated in obesity, steatosis, and MASH in both humans and rodents. Animal studies have shown that feeding mice with an AIN-76A western diet significantly induces CYP2E1 expression, leading to the development of MASH and fibrosis. Conversely, CYP2E1-null mice are protected from these detrimental effects []. Furthermore, CYP2E1 may contribute to excessive lipid accumulation and worsen oxidative stress, thereby inducing hepatic inflammation and causing various forms of hepatocyte damage and death []. Hence, targeting CYP2E1 expression is a potentially effective treatment strategy against MASLD and MASH.\n\nThe primary objective of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of SNP-630, a novel synthetic molecule, and its metabolites in treating MASH in both animal models and patients with MASH.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nIn vitro metabolism of SNP-630\n\nSNP-630 was added to human blood containing antibacterial agents methylparaben and propylparaben and incubated at 37 \u2103. Samples were collected at the indicated time points, mixed with cold acetonitrile, and centrifuged at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 13,000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min. The supernatant was transferred to a tube and stored at\u2009\u2212\u200978\u00a0\u00b0C until analysis with HPLC\u2013MS/MS.\n\nAn LC\u2013MS/MS assay for the determination of SNP-630 and its four metabolites in human plasma was conducted. Briefly, human plasma samples were spiked with internal standard, processed with solid-phase extraction, and analyzed using reversed-phase HPLC with electrospray ionization, Turbo Ion Spray\u00ae MS/MS detection. Negative (M-H)\u2212 ions for SNP-630 and Chlorzoxazone-d3 (Internal standard, IS) were monitored in MRM mode. Analyte-to-IS peak area ratios for the standards were used to create a linear calibration curve using 1/x2 weighted least-squares regression analysis.\n\nFor metabolite 2 (m2) and metabolite 4 (m4) analysis, human plasma samples were spiked with internal standard, processed by solid-phase extraction, and analyzed using reversed-phase HPLC with electrospray ionization, Turbo Ion Spray\u00ae MS/MS detection. Negative (M-H)\u2212 ions for m2, m4, m2-d6 (IS), and Chlorzoxazone-d3 (IS) were monitored in MRM mode. Analyte-to-IS peak area ratios for the standards were used to create a linear calibration curve using 1/x2 weighted least-squares regression analysis. For m1 and m3 analysis, human plasma samples were spiked with internal standard, processed via acetylation derivatization, and analyzed using reversed-phase HPLC with electrospray ionization, Turbo Ion Spray\u00ae MS/MS detection. Positive (M\u2009+\u2009H)+ ions for m1, m3, and m1-13C6 (IS) were monitored in MRM mode. Analyte-to-IS peak area ratios for the standards were used to create a linear calibration curve using 1/x2 weighted least-squares regression analysis.\n\n\nIn vivo CYP2E1 activity\n\nIn vivo, CYP2E1 activity has been previously described []. Briefly, high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice treated with SNP-630 for 12\u00a0weeks were fasted overnight and administered an oral dose of chlorzoxazone (8.33\u00a0mg/kg) as a probe. Whole blood was then collected via the tail vein 15\u00a0min post-administration and stored at \u201320 \u2103 until analysis. Blood concentrations of chlorzoxazone and 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone were measured using LC/MS/MS as described previously []. The activity was described as the blood concentration ratios of 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone to chlorzoxazone.\n\n\nExperimental animal model\n\nMice were housed in a pathogen-free environment with a 12\u00a0h-light/12\u00a0h-dark cycle and free access to food and water. All animal husbandry, care, euthanasia, and use procedures followed the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the National Defense Medical Center (approval number: IACUC-15-309). MASH was induced in male C57BL/6 (B6) mice. The mice were purchased from the National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan) at the age of 8\u201310\u00a0weeks and housed at the Laboratory Animal Center of the National Defense Medical Center. The mice were fed with a standard diet of 3\u20135\u00a0g/day, provided water ad libitum for 1\u20132\u00a0weeks, and verified to be healthy before initiation of the study. The weight of the mice was recorded once per week.\n\n\nSNP-630 treatment\n\nB6 mice were allocated randomly to the blank group, vehicle control high-fat diet (HFD) group, and SNP-630 treatment via oral gavage group. Mice in the blank group (n\u2009=\u20098) were fed with a standard diet (13% calories from fat; Laboratory Autoclavable Rodent Diet 5010, LabDiet, Fort Worth, USA); Mice in the HFD group (n\u2009=\u20098) were fed with HFD (60% calories from fat; Research DIETS D12492) for entire study of 30\u00a0weeks. Mice in the SNP-630 treatment groups (n\u2009=\u20098/group) were fed with HFD for the entire study duration (30\u00a0weeks) and administered 250, 150, 75, or 25\u00a0mg/kg SNP-630 once daily by oral gavage for the last 10\u00a0weeks of the experiment.\n\n\nSNP-630-MS treatment\n\nMale B6 mice were used for the SNP-630-MS treatment efficacy tests. MASH was induced with HFD for 21\u00a0weeks. The mice were allocated randomly to the blank group, vehicle control HFD group, and SNP-630-MS treatment via oral gavage group. Mice in the blank group (n\u2009=\u20098) were fed a standard diet; mice in the HFD group (n\u2009=\u20098) were fed with HFD (60% calories from fat; Research DIETS D12492) for 21\u00a0weeks; mice in the SNP-630-MS treatment groups (n\u2009=\u20098/group) were also fed with HFD and co-administered 62.5/62.5 or 187.5/187.5\u00a0mg/kg SNP-630-MS daily for 21\u00a0weeks.\n\n\nPlasma biochemistry of MASH mice\n\nIn the animal models, submandibular blood was collected for biochemical tests. At the end of the study, all mice were weighed and euthanized using CO2. The blood specimens were allowed to clot at 24\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h, and the serum was separated via centrifugation in a refrigerated centrifuge at 15,700\u2009\u00d7\u2009g and 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. Serum ALT levels were subsequently assayed by the National Laboratory Animal Center.\n\n\nLiver triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TCHO) assays\n\nAnimal liver samples were homogenized in 2\u00a0mL Folch reagent on ice, centrifuged at 1,977\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, and 1.6\u00a0mL of the supernatant was then transferred into a new tube containing 0.8\u00a0mL saline. The pellet at the bottom of the centrifuged tube was resuspended in 2\u00a0mL of Folch reagent and the mixture was shaken for 20\u00a0min, followed by centrifugation at 1,977\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, and 1.6\u00a0mL of the supernatant was then transferred to the tube that contained the supernatant from the first-run centrifugation, shaken for 30\u00a0s, and centrifuged at 1,977\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. A total of 2\u00a0mL of the bottom layer liquid was transferred to a glass container, air dried under a nitrogen stream, and the sample was fully dissolved in EtOH: Triton X-100 (3:1 v:v) with sonication. Liver TG and TCHO levels were analyzed using RANDOX TG and RANDOX CHOL kits, respectively, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Absorbance measurements were performed using an Epoch 2 Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek). Liver TG and TCHO levels were calculated using standard curves and normalized to the weight of the liver in the sample.\n\n\nHistopathological tissue sectioning, staining, and evaluation\n\nFollowing euthanasia, approximately 1 cm3 of the largest right lobe of the liver was excised from the same position to eliminate bias due to subjective observation, fixed in 10% neutral formalin, and dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 95%, and 99.5%), followed by xylene. The fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-\u03bcm sections using a microtome, mounted on clean slides, and dried at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. To identify lesions, fat accumulation, necrosis, and fibrosis in liver cells due to ongoing liver damage, the liver sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to evaluate the degree of liver fat accumulation and with Sirius Red to evaluate the degree of fibrosis. Semi-quantitative pathological assessment was performed by a physician or veterinary pathologist in a double-blinded manner to score (NAFLD Activity Score [NAS]). Finally, a differential analysis of the scores for each group was conducted using the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test.\n\n\nWestern blotting\n\nFifty microgram liver tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer to obtain total proteins, (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat no. 9806) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche, Cat no. 5892970001) and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Cat no. 4906837001).\u00a0The samples were incubated for 30\u00a0min on ice. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23,225). Equal amounts of protein (15\u00a0\u03bcg) were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Merck Millipore, IPVH00010). The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, A2058) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature and the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The utilized primary antibodies were rabbit anti-CYP2E1 (1:1000, Abcam ab28146) and\u00a0mouse anti-ACTB (1:5000, actin-beta, Abcam ab8226) and secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse conjugated with HRP (1:10,000, Abcam ab97023), and HRP Donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000, BioLegend Cat no. 406401). The bands were imaged and analyzed with the Image J software (National Institutes of Health, https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The relative density was calculated as the ratio of the intensity of the protein of interest to that of ACTB, and all band detection was within the linear range.\n\n\nReal-time PCR\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from 50\u00a0mg of mice liver tissue using EasyPure total RNA extraction kit (Bioman Cat no. RT050, Taiwan) and submitted to DNase I treatment (Bioman, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA concentration and purity were evaluated using spectrophotometry (Nanodrop One, Thermo Scientific). RNA (1\u00a0\u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-rad Cat no. 1708890, USA) in a 20\u00a0\u03bcL reaction according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. 50\u00a0ng of cDNA templates was amplified in duplicates using iTaq universal SYBR green supermix (Bio-rad Cat no. 1725124, USA) on a CFX96 Real-Time PCR System (Bio-rad, USA). Transcripts were amplified using the following program: 5\u00a0min at 95\u00a0\u2103 followed by 40 cycles of 10\u00a0s at 95\u00a0\u2103 and 30\u00a0s at 60\u00a0\u2103. Relative mRNA expression was quantified using the 2\u2212\u25b3\u25b3Ct method and Gapdh as the housekeeping gene. The following primers were used for Real-Time PCR (5\u2032-3\u2032): Gapdh-Forward: CGTGTTCCTACCCCCAATGT, Gapdh-Reverse: GTTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCAGG, Col1a1-Forward: TTCACCTACAGCACCCTTGT, Col1a1-Reverse:TTGGGGTGGAGGGAGTTTAC, Col3a1-Forward: CGGCTGAGTTTTATGACGGG, Col3a1-Reverse: ATAGGACTGACCAAGGTGGC, Timp1-Forward: TGGCATCTGGCATCCTCTTG, Timp1-Reverse: GGTCTCGTTGATTTCTGGGGA, Acta2-Forward: CCCTGGAGAAGAGCTACGAAC, Acta2-Reverse: GACAGGACGTTGTTAGCATAGAG.\n\n\nSNP-630-MS clinical study\n\n\nStudy design and patients\n\nWe conducted a phase 2 study, comprising a 12-week dosing phase and a 2-week safety follow-up period, in patients with MASH. The individuals enrolled in this study satisfied the following inclusion criteria: (1) age\u2009\u2265\u200920-years-old, body weight\u2009\u2265\u200954\u00a0kg, and liver fat content\u2009\u2265\u200910.0% as measured using MRI; (2) phenotypic diagnosis of MASH based on one or more of the following criteria: alanine aminotransferase ALT levels\u2009\u2265\u20091.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT\u2009\u2265\u2009ULN and body mass index (BMI)\u2009\u2265\u200925 and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus; (3) adequate organ function: hemoglobin\u2009\u2265\u20099\u00a0g/dL, platelet count\u2009\u2265\u2009100\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L, white blood cell count\u2009\u2265\u20093.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L, creatinine clearance\u2009\u2265\u200990\u00a0mL/min (determined by the Cockcroft-Gault equation), and serum uric acid\u2009<\u20099.0\u00a0mg/dL; and (4) able to provide written informed consent and understand and comply with the requirements of the study.\n\nIndividuals were excluded from the study if they met the following exclusion criteria: (1) decompensated or severe liver disease, a history or presence of alcohol abuse, and/or being unable to undergo an MRI scan; (2) having electronically, magnetically, and mechanically activated implanted devices; (3) a significant systemic or major illness other than liver disease; (4) a documented history of a serious allergic reaction to SNP-630-MS or any structurally related compounds; (5) patients with diabetes who did not maintain a stable dose of oral medication for hyperglycemia or had changed their insulin dose by\u2009>\u200910% over the past two months; (6) regularly using agents that are potent against hepatitis or affect lipid metabolism; (7) women who were pregnant or lactating; and (8) women of child-bearing potential who were not committed to taking reliable contraception during their participation in the study and for at least 4\u00a0weeks after the end of the study treatment period.\n\nThe investigational products (IPs), including study agents and control products, were supplied by the Investigational New Drug (IND) sponsor and shipped to the hospital pharmacy before initiating participant enrollment. We provided the physician investigator with the packaged study agent labeled in accordance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Each open-label period kit contained a supply of IPs sufficient for 5\u00a0weeks and 1\u00a0week in reserve. The participants were instructed to take a dose, either 800 or 400\u00a0mg of SNP-630-MS or the matched placebo once daily after a meal.\n\nThe safety profile of the study agent was assessed by monitoring and recording the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious TEAEs, whether related to the study treatment or not, as determined by changes in clinical laboratory tests (i.e., hematological and biochemical tests, including iron panels), physical examinations, vital signs, standard electrocardiograms, and any other untoward medical events during the study period. Safety was evaluated for all participants who received at least one dose of study medication.\n\n\nPrimary and secondary endpoints\n\nThe primary outcome was the change in serum ALT (also called GPT) at week 12 compared with baseline. This endpoint was based on the US-FDA guidance Noncirrhotic Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis with Liver Fibrosis: Developing Drugs for Treatment as non-invasive, disease specific biomarker for early phase 2 trials. Secondary outcomes were as follows: (1) percentage changes in ALT, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST, also called GOT), alkaline phosphatase (Alk-P), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3-GT), and serum CK-18 fragment levels at week 12 compared with baseline; (2) reduction in liver fat content, measured noninvasively based on the proton density fat fraction (PDFF) on MRI, at completion of week 12 compared with baseline; (3) percentage of patients who experience AE/SAE and those who experience AEs leading to discontinuation at the end of dosing.\n\n\nData analysis\n\n\nEffects of SNP-630 and its metabolites in an animal model of MASH\n\nData are expressed as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error (SEM). Statistical significance was determined via one-way analysis of variance using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Version 13 (SPSS Inc.). Multiple comparisons were subsequently carried out using post-hoc least significant difference tests to confirm the significance of the differences between groups. Means were considered significantly different at P\u2009<\u20090.05. The statistical differences for total NAS were assessed using the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test.\n\n\nSNP-630-MS clinical study\n\nTo investigate the efficacy and safety of SNP-630-MS in patients with MASH, the primary and secondary endpoints at week 12 were compared with the corresponding baseline values. The primary efficacy analysis compared the percentage reduction in ALT, assuming that the participants who received SNP-630-MS would exhibit a significant reduction in liver fat that was superior to baseline at a significance level of 0.05. The absolute values of the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints at week 12 were also compared with the baseline values using paired t-tests.\n\nAnalysis datasets were planned for the \u201cintention-to-treat (ITT)\u201d population, which was the full analysis set (FAS), including all participants who received at least one dose of the study agent. The per-protocol analysis dataset (PP) was used to define the subset of the participants in the FAS who completed their scheduled visits with no missing ALT values at baseline or week 12. participants in the PP dataset must have taken at least 80% of the investigational product for 80% of the days in the study period, with no major violation of the required procedures of the protocol. The safety population included all participants who received at least one dose of the study agent (ITT).\n\nSubgroup analyses were conducted in several subpopulations, including the \u201cITT\u201d or \u201cPP\u201d populations by sex, BMI, age, history of alcohol consumption, baseline ALT, baseline liver fat content, and administered dose.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nMetabolic pathway and mechanism of action of SNP-630 and SNP-630-MS\n\nWhen incubated with human whole blood at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, SNP-630 underwent metabolic processes that led to the formation of four major metabolites (Fig.\u00a0b). The metabolic pathway of SNP-630 is illustrated in Fig.\u00a0a. SNP-630-MS is a mixture of two active metabolites produced by SNP-630 metabolism.\n\nMetabolic scheme and profile of SNP-630. a Schematic illustration of SNP-630 metabolism. The structures of new chemical entities, SNP-630 and SNP-630-MS, are shown. b Metabolic profiles of SNP-630 (% remaining) and its metabolites (% formation) in human blood\n\n\nSNP-630 ameliorates HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation in mice\n\nConsidering the induction of CYP2E1 activation and expression in patients with MASLD or MASH [\u2013], we were intrigued by the potential of SNP-630 to inhibit CYP2E1 activity and expression in a mouse model of MASLD. We induced MASH in mice with HFD for 20\u00a0weeks and administered SNP-630 orally while continuing the HFD for an additional 10\u00a0weeks. After 30\u00a0weeks of HFD feeding, mice in the HFD group exhibited an increase in CYP2E1 protein expression; however, treatment with SNP-630 significantly inhibited the protein expression and activity of CYP2E1 (Fig.\u00a0a\u2013c), accompanied with a notable decrease in body weight, liver weight/body weight ratio, and hepatic lipid content (triglycerides, TG and cholesterol, T-CHO) (Fig.\u00a0d\u2013f and Additional File b). Histological analysis using H&E staining revealed the presence of cytoplasmic fat vacuoles and droplets in the hepatocytes of mice fed with the HFD diet, whereas mice treated with SNP-630 exhibited smaller fatty droplets and reduced ballooning degeneration in hepatocytes (Fig.\u00a0h, i). Furthermore, SNP-630 treatment significantly decreased cytokine and chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and CCL4 expression, further indicating the reduction in hepatic inflammation (Additional File c, d). The increase in liver injury biomarkers induced by the HFD was restored by SNP-630, as evidenced by remarkably decreased serum ALT activities (Fig.\u00a0g).\n\nSNP-630 treatment alleviates HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in the MASH mouse model. a SNP-630 inhibits CYP2E1 catalytic activity. The metabolic ratios of chlorzoxazone (CZX) and its CYP2E1-drived metabolite, 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone (6-OH-CZX), in mice are plotted versus the SNP-630 treatment dose. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE (n\u2009=\u20098 for each group). b Representative immunoblots of SNP-630 treatment significantly reduced CYP2E1 protein expression.

Fields from Sirius red-stained sections were scanned using a slide scanner (Axio Scan.Z1), and the fibrotic area was measured with digital image analysis using the ImageJ software (k) Representative results of expression of hepatic Col3a1 mRNA. l Representative results of expression of hepatic Timp1 mRNA. Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. Statistical analyses were carried out using a one-way analysis of variance (n\u2009=\u20098/each group). MASH: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis; HFD: high-fat diet\n\nTo assess the progression of steatohepatitis in mice, we evaluated the extent of liver fibrosis. Mice fed with HFD exhibited a greater area of fibrils stained with Sirius Red, while treatment with SNP-630 resulted in a significant reduction in hepatic fibrosis in these mice (Fig.\u00a0h, j). Additionally, we examined the expression levels of fibrogenic genes, Co1a1, Col3a1, and Timp1. As depicted in Fig.\u00a0, the expression of these fibrogenic genes was upregulated in mice fed with HFD compared with those fed with a normal diet. Notably, treatment with SNP-630 led to a significant reduction in the expression of these fibrotic genes, further supporting the evidence of reduced liver injury by SNP-630 (Fig.\u00a0j-l and Additional File e).\n\nRecently, studies reported the role of LPS from the gut microbiota in favoring the occurrence of MASH. Interestingly, SNP-630 normalized the elevated LPS levels in HFD diet-fed mice (unpublished data).\n\n\nSNP-630-MS, active metabolites of SNP-630, ameliorates HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation in mice\n\nGiven the rapid conversion of SNP-630 into four active metabolites in vivo, we next determined whether the amelioration of HFD-induced MASH by SNP-630 is mediated through its active metabolites. Two of these active metabolites were synthesized and combined to create SNP-630-MS (Fig.\u00a0a). To assess the hepatoprotective effects of SNP-630-MS in MASH, mice were fed with HFD for 21\u00a0weeks. SNP-630-MS significantly reduced the weight gain and protein expression of CYP2E1 (Fig.\u00a0a and Additional File a). The levels of liver TG and TCHO were elevated in the HFD group compared with the control group. In contrast, administration of SNP-630-MS resulted in a decrease in liver/body weight ratio, hepatic TG, and TCHO levels in treated mice (Fig.\u00a0b-d). Additionally, the HFD group exhibited elevated ALT levels, whereas mice treated with SNP-630-MS showed significantly reduced ALT levels (Fig.\u00a0e).\n\nHepaprotective effects of SNP-630-MS on the HFD-induced mouse model of MASH. MASH was induced in male C57BL/6 mice with HFD for 21\u00a0weeks. HFD-induced MASH mice were divided into three groups and received an HFD along with vehicle, 187.5/187.5 (assigned as SNP-630-MS-High), or 62.5/62.5\u00a0mg/kg SNP-630-MS (assigned as SNP-630-MS-Low) by oral gavage once daily. Mice on a normal chow diet received the vehicle as the normal control (blank group). a Body weight, b liver/body weight ratio, c liver TG, d liver TCHO, e ALT, f NAS, g fibrosis stage, h expression of hepatic Col3a1 mRNA, and (i) expression of hepatic Timp1 mRNA. Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. Statistical analyses were carried out using a one-way analysis of variance (n\u2009=\u200912/each group). MASH: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis; HFD: high-fat diet\n\nHistological analysis using H&E staining uncovered notable steatosis, inflammation, and hepatic ballooning in the livers of mice fed with HFD, leading to an average NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) of 3.7. Conversely, mice treated with a high dose of SNP-630-MS displayed diminished hepatic steatotic vesicles, inflammation, and ballooning, resulting in an average NAS of 1.3 (Fig.\u00a0f). Furthermore, the fibrosis score was significantly increased in HFD-induced mice compared with those on a chow diet, however, administration of SNP-630-MS dose-dependently attenuated the fibrosis levels and the expression of fibrotic genes Col3a1 and Timp-1\n(Fig.\u00a0g-i). These findings suggest that SNP-630-MS inhibited the pathological progression of HFD-induced MASLD by reducing hepatic lipid accumulation, improving NAS, and preventing liver injury.\n\n\nLong-term application of SNP-630 and SNP-630-MS was safe in mice\n\nThe long-term safety of SNP-630 and SNP-630-MS was assessed in mice. No abnormal findings were observed in the liver, kidney, spleen, or heart of mice treated with SNP-630 and SNP-630-MS. Additionally, no diseases or abnormal clinical findings related to the administration of SNP-630 and SNP-630-MS were observed during necropsy studies conducted at the end of the experiment (Data not shown). These findings indicate that both compounds are safe for long-term use.\n\n\nClinical trial of SNP-630-MS\n\n\nParticipants and baseline characteristics\n\nThis open-label study was initiated at Tri-Service General Hospital, a participating medical center in Taiwan. A total of 90 patients with MASH were screened for enrollment, of which 17 were enrolled in the first arm, receiving two tablets of SNP-630-MS, assigned as high dose group, and 18 in the second arm, receiving one tablet of SNP-630-MS, assigned as low dose group. One patient (5.9%) in the first arm withdrew voluntarily after 3\u00a0days of SNP-630-MS dosing. The schematic of the clinical trial progress is presented in Fig.\u00a0.\n\nSNP-630-MS clinical trial profile. a The disposition of one participant who withdrew after 3\u00a0days of dosing cannot be reported. b Analysis of primary efficacy for the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population. ALT: alanine aminotransferase\n\nThe baseline demographics and disease characteristics of the participants were evenly distributed between the two dosing groups, as shown in Table\u00a0. The mean age of the participants was 44.45\u00a0years, with 83% being male and a mean body mass index of 30.5\u00a0kg/m2. Approximately 51.42% of the patients had diabetes or pre-diabetes. All patients met the liver enzyme entry criteria for this study.\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics at baseline\n\nData are expressed as n (%) or mean (SD).

Patients treated with SNP-630-MS exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in serum ALT levels at week 12 compared with baseline (\u221229.5\u2009\u00b1\u200933.0 U/L, P\u2009=\u20090.002 for high-dose SNP-630-MS and \u221218.9\u2009\u00b1\u200927.3 U/L, P\u2009=\u20090.009 for low-dose SNP-630-MS). The decrease in serum ALT was observed during the first 8\u00a0weeks of SNP-630-MS dosing and sustained throughout the treatment period (Fig.\u00a0a).\n\nSNP-630-MS met the primary endpoint of improvement in ALT after 12-week treatment in mITT population. a Participants meet the primary endpoint (improvement in ALT). Mean changes from baseline during treatment with two SNP-630-MS tablets (n\u2009=\u200917) and one SNP-630-MS tablet (n\u2009=\u200918) daily for up to 12\u00a0weeks.

After adjusting for all potential confounding variables, a significant association was observed between ALT reduction and SNP-630-MS treatment in all analyzed subgroups, including age group, sex, obesity status, PNPLA3 genotype, fibrosis stage, and diabetes.\n\n\nKey secondary and exploratory outcomes\n\nSignificant reductions in serum AST (\u221213.1\u2009\u00b1\u200923.2 U/L, P\u2009=\u20090.034) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, \u221220.2\u2009\u00b1\u200938.0 U/L, P\u2009=\u20090.044) were observed after 12\u00a0weeks of treatment with two tablets of SNP-630-MS (Table\u00a0). Notably, SNP-630-MS treatment significantly improved glycemic control. Fasting serum glucose levels showed a significant reduction (\u221219.9\u2009\u00b1\u200930.3 U/L, P\u2009=\u20090.016; Table\u00a0), and there was a slight decrease in insulin levels and HOMA-IR, indicating lower insulin resistance after administration of two tablets of SNP-630-MS at week 12 compared with baseline. Furthermore, SNP-630-MS treatment was associated with significant reductions in both relative and absolute hepatic fat fraction compared with baseline (Table\u00a0). Favorable decreases were also observed in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels.\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics at baseline and week 12 following SNP-630-MS treatment\n\nData are expressed as n (%) or means (standard deviation)\n\nALT alanine aminotransferase, AST aspartate aminotransferase, HDL high-density lipoprotein, LDL low-density lipoprotein, HOMA-IR homoeostasis model assessment\u2013estimated insulin resistance, CCL2 chemokine (C\u2013C motif) ligand 2, also referred to as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; CCL4 chemokine (C\u2013C motif) ligand 4, also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2; chemokine (C\u2013C motif) ligand 5, also known as regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES); IL-1 beta, interleukin 1 beta; SD: standard deviation. *P\u2009<\u20090\u00b705, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P\u2009<\u20090.005 compared to baseline\n\n\u00a7In other laboratory results, n\u2009=\u200916 for the two tablets.

Finally, participants receiving the higher dose experienced an average reduction of 0.5\u00a0kg/m2 in BMI (Table\u00a0).\n\nSignificant reductions were also observed in the circulating levels of cytokines and chemokines involved in liver inflammation and fibrosis, such as CCL4, CCL5, and caspase 3, after 12\u00a0weeks of SNP-630-MS dosing (Table\u00a0). Furthermore, liver stiffness, as measured using FibroScan, showed a significant decrease (P\u2009=\u20090.03) in patients with F4 stage fibrosis who received SNP-630-MS treatment (Fig.\u00a0c). These findings indicate the potential of SNP-630-MS to reduce liver inflammation and fibrosis in patients with MASH.\n\n\nSafety and tolerability\n\nThe safety analysis included all 36 patients with MASH who received at least one dose of the study agent. Adverse events were generally mild and unrelated to the treatment. Throughout the study, a total of four treatment-unrelated adverse events were reported, including acute bronchitis, acute pharyngitis, acute sinusitis, and arthropathy. These adverse events were determined to be of \"mild\" intensity by the investigators. Importantly, no serious adverse events were reported in this trial as of the writing of this manuscript, indicating the favorable safety profile of the treatment.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nDespite significant progress in understanding the pathogenesis of MASLD and efforts to develop therapeutic interventions, there remain substantial challenges and no approved treatment for this disease. In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have unsuccessfully attempted to develop effective drugs for MASH, primarily due to a lack of efficacy, toxicity concerns, or a combination of both [].\n\nMost clinical trials for MASH have traditionally focused on single-agent (monotherapy) approaches. However, considering the complex pathophysiology of the disease and the presence of multiple escape pathways, it is increasingly evident that developing a single drug capable of effectively treating most patients is becoming more challenging and less likely to succeed []. As a result, there is growing recognition among drug developers that a single agent or a combination of therapies with different but complementary mechanisms of action may offer the best approach to enhance efficacy, slow disease progression, or even reverse MASH []. This shift toward combination therapies is aimed at targeting multiple pathways and achieving synergistic effects to address the heterogeneity of MASH and improve treatment outcomes.\n\nIn this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation to evaluate the therapeutic potential of SNP-630 and its metabolites (SNP-630-MS) with multiple mechanisms in the context of MASH. Initially, we demonstrated that both SNP-630 and SNP-630-MS could effectively inhibit the activity of CYP2E1 enzyme in vivo (Fig.\u00a0a), and expression of CYP2E1 enzyme in animal models of MASH (Fig.\u00a0 b, c and Additional File a), subsequently reducing hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrogenesis (Fig.\u00a0). These findings highlight the multifaceted therapeutic effects of SNP-630 and its metabolites, making them promising candidates for the treatment of MASH. Building upon this evidence, we proceeded to administer SNP-630-MS to patients with MASH to confirm the efficacy and safety observed in preclinical studies, further validating the potential of SNP-630 as a therapeutic intervention for MASH.\n\nSNP-630 and its active metabolites possess multiple potential mechanisms of action, specifically targeting the underlying pathogenic pathways implicated in MASH. Studies have elucidated that hepatic DNL, characterized by an abnormal increase in newly synthesized fatty acids in the liver, plays a pivotal role in the development of steatosis and the progression of MASLD [, ]. Key regulators involved in this process include SREBP-1c, which controls the transcription of genes related to hepatic triglyceride synthesis, and PPAR\u03b1, responsible for regulating gene transcription involved in fatty acid esterification and oxidation [, ]. Additionally, evidence suggests that CYP2E1, by inhibiting PPAR\u03b1 and enhancing SREBP-1c, can impact fat synthesis and metabolism [, ]. Therefore, SNP-630 and its metabolites effectively target these regulatory factors, exerting a modulatory effect on hepatic de novo lipogenesis and associated metabolic pathways. By intervening at these crucial points, SNP-630 and its metabolites demonstrate their potential to mitigate the pathogenesis of MASH and contribute to the management of the disease.\n\nMoreover, the activation of resident hepatic macrophages, known as Kupffer cells, occurs in response to gut-derived LPS, saturated fatty acids, cytokines, and injured hepatocytes and triggers the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation []. Notably, macrophages exhibiting elevated expression of CYP2E1 show increased levels of CD14 and its co-receptor TLR4, as well as enhanced activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB []. This increased expression of CYP2E1 primes macrophages, rendering them more responsive to lipopolysaccharide stimuli and leading to heightened production of TNF-\u03b1 [, ]. These findings suggest that SNP-630 and its active metabolites, such as SNP-630-MS, modulate Kupffer cell activation by regulating the activity and expression of CYP2E1. However, further validation is necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Nonetheless, these insights highlight a potential mechanism through which SNP-630 and its metabolites could impact the activation of hepatic macrophages and the subsequent inflammatory response in the context of MASH. Growing investigations held the intestinal barrier dysfunction blame for inflaming the MASLD progression. During the initiation and progression of MASH, large amounts of gut bacterial metabolites and bacterial components such as LPS enter the liver through the portal vein due to the intestinal barrier disruption with the increased intestinal permeability. Mice treated with SNP-630 or SNP-630-MS showed normalized LPS levels compared with HFD control (unpublished data), suggesting that SNP-630 and SNP-630-MS might also improve intestinal function. Further studies are warranted to confirm this speculation.\n\nFurthermore, emerging evidence suggests that adaptive immune mechanisms play crucial roles in the progression of steatosis, insulin resistance, inflammation, and fibrosis in MASH [, ]. Experimental models of steatohepatitis and patients with MASH have shown increased recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to the liver [, ]. The elevated numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the liver are associated with higher frequencies of IFN\u03b3-expressing CD4 and CD8 T cells in the blood of patients with MASH, respectively [, ]. Additionally, plasma levels of IFN\u03b3 correlate positively with the presence and size of hepatic lymphocyte aggregates, as well as the severity of fibrosis. Recent studies have suggested that one of the active metabolites of SNP-630 exhibits immunomodulatory effects by limiting T cell proliferation and differentiation []. This finding suggests that SNP-630 alleviates MASH by inhibiting T-cell infiltration in the liver, although further confirmation is required. Furthermore, another active metabolite of SNP-630 has a dual regulatory role in promoting fat browning and enhancing lipid homeostasis in cultured white adipocytes []. Collectively, these studies provide support for the potential anti-MASH properties of SNP-630 and its active metabolites through the regulation of lipid metabolism, Kupffer cell activation, T-cell infiltration, and intestinal function.\n\nIn the present phase 2 trial of patients with MASH, SNP-630-MS, an active metabolite of SNP-630, was utilized as a proof-of-concept. This open-label study evaluated the efficacy of SNP-630-MS in treating MASH. After 12\u00a0weeks of treatment, significant anti-inflammatory effects were observed, as evidenced by a substantial decrease in serum ALT levels from baseline (Fig.\u00a0a). The reduction in ALT was \u201318.9 U/L for SNP-630-MS (one tablet) and \u201329.5 U/L for SNP-630-MS (two tablets). Interestingly, when compared with Ocaliva from Intercept and Resmetirom from Madrigal, both of which have shown improvement in MASH during phase 3 trials, SNP-630-MS exhibited stronger efficacy in reducing ALT levels and demonstrated better safety and tolerability profiles than these other candidate drugs at a similar stage of development [, ].\n\nThe predisposition to MASLD is influenced by various genetic polymorphisms. Among these genetic variants, the PNPLA-3 rs738409 C\u2009>\u2009G (I148C/G-G/G) genotype is considered a common determinant of MASLD []. Patients with this genotype are associated with higher liver fat accumulation, increased risk of fibrosis, and reduced benefits from treatments compared with those with the wild-type genotype [, ]. In our study, we observed a significant reduction in serum ALT levels after SNP-630-MS treatment specifically in patients with PNPLA3 rs738409 GG or wild-type genotype (Fig.\u00a0b). MASLD often coexists with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), but the impact of T2DM on the efficacy of the drug remains unclear. Subgroup analysis revealed that SNP-630-MS was effective in both patients with and without T2DM (Fig.\u00a0b). Additionally, fasting glucose and HOMA-IR, markers of glucose metabolism, showed significant improvements in patients treated with SNP-630-MS (Table\u00a0). These findings suggest that SNP-630-MS may have potential pharmacological benefits in treating T2DM, although further research is required to fully comprehend its clinical implications.Consistent with the findings from our animal studies (Figs.  and ), SNP-630-MS demonstrated anti-steatosis activity in patients with MASH. Specifically, the low-dose group showed a significant reduction of 14.5% in MRI-PDFF, indicating a decrease in liver fat content (Table\u00a0). However, in the high-dose group, no significant decrease was observed in MRI-PDFF, possibly due to the presence of outliers in the dataset. To address this, we applied the interquartile rule to identify and remove outliers from the data. After eliminating the outliers, we observed a significant reduction of 10.2% in MRI-PDFF in the high-dose SNP-630-MS group. Nevertheless, it is important to note that further experiments are required to validate these results.\n\nFurthermore, SNP-630-MS exhibited strong anti-fibrotic potential by significantly reducing fibrogenesis-related biomarkers. Liver inflammation, which plays a crucial role in fibrosis development, is regulated by CC chemokines that control important chemokine pathways []. Notably, treatment with SNP-630-MS resulted in a significant decrease in serum levels of CCL4 and CCL5 in patients with MASH, indicating its effectiveness in suppressing the fibrogenic response (Table\u00a0). Additionally, FibroScan measurements demonstrated the efficacy of SNP-630-MS in improving liver fibrosis. Interestingly, after 12\u00a0weeks of SNP-630-MS treatment, there was a significant reduction in liver stiffness (kPa) among patients with a baseline FibroScan fibrosis score of F4, indicating the potential of SNP-630-MS to ameliorate liver fibrosis (Fig.\u00a0c).\n\nSNP-630-MS was generally well tolerated; no SAE was reported in this study. Data on human exposure to each of the components of SNP-630-MS have been well-established and reported in a comprehensive series of toxicological studies. Therefore, the safety issues had already been evaluated and none were expected.\n\nNo more than approximately 40% of patients in MASH clinical trials have shown significant benefit from monotherapy []. This phenomenon of reduced efficacy can be broadly considered a mechanism of drug resistance. Given that MAFLD is a complex, multifactorial disease with various mechanisms involved, it is unlikely that a single drug will effectively address all its aspects. In this context, thyroid hormone receptor beta (THR\u03b2) agonists, FGF21 analogues, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1Ras) exhibit varying degrees of therapeutic benefits for different pathological features of MAFLD and its related metabolic comorbidities [], For example, FGF21 analogues and THR\u03b2 agonists appear to be more potent than GLP-1RAs in amelioration of hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, but have minimal effects on obesity, insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia.\u00a0In contrast, the amelioration in MAFLD by GLP-1RAs is accompanied by obvious improvement in weight loss and glycaemic control. Additionally, compensatory mechanisms might be involved in long-term drug treatment. For instance, Inhibition of ACLY, an enzyme involved in DNL, can be passed in the liver of mice fed a high-fructose diet [] through upregulation of ACSS2. In addition, CYP4A could serve as a compensatory mechanism in the absence of CYP2E1 [], which may lead to reduced efficacy in eliminating lipid peroxidation. Therefore, combination of agents might seem a logical approach to increase efficacy, with numerous combinations possible.\u201d\n\n\nLimitations\n\nLimitations of the present study include its design as a longitudinal trial without a placebo group. To address this limitation, we utilized baseline measurements as a control for comparison. Despite this, significant improvements in anti-inflammatory, anti-steatosis, and anti-fibrotic parameters were observed in patients receiving SNP-630-MS treatment compared to baseline. Another limitation of this study is the lack of liver biopsy results since histological evaluation plays an important role in the development of new drugs for MASH []. To achieve a breakthrough in the development of MASH therapeutic drugs, liver biopsies should be required in the trial design. Furthermore, lacking double-blind randomized protocol was also noted in the present study. Therefore, to further confirm the efficacy of SNP-630-MS, additional randomized placebo-controlled studies in patients with biopsy-proven MASH will be conducted in the future.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe findings of this study highlighted the potential of the novel SNP-630 and its metabolites in mitigating hepatic steatosis, MASH injury, and fibrosis through diverse mechanisms in a murine model of MASH. This study provides evidence for the efficacy and safety of SNP-630-MS, the active metabolites of SNP-630, in patients diagnosed with MASH and proposes SNP-630 and its active metabolites as promising candidates for the treatment of MASH. These finding are valuable for researchers aiming to understand pathophysiology and develop new therapies. Additionally, there is potential for the future availability of a unique oral therapy for MASH, which could be significant for patients, providers and caregivers seeking to prevent the progression and complications of this disease.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nAdditional file 1: SNP-630 and SNP-630-MS inhibit CYP2E1 protein expression in a mouse model of MASH.

A recent gout GWAS identified a signal of genetic association at a locus encompassing IL1RN-IL1F10. Colocalisation analysis using Genotype Tissue Expression Database (GTEx) eQTL data showed that the signal overlaps with genetic control of IL1RN/IL1F10 gene expression. We assess the functional implications of IL1RN rs9973741, the lead gout-associated variant.MethodsWe conducted functional validation of IL1RN rs9973741 in patients with gout and controls. The transcription level of IL1RN/IL1F10 was investigated in unstimulated or MSU-crystal co-stimulated PBMCs. Ex vivo functional assays were performed in PBMCs stimulated with C16\u2009+\u2009MSU crystals or LPS for 24\u00a0h. Cytokine levels were assessed by ELISA.ResultsIn unstimulated PBMCs, no association of IL1RN rs9973741 (gout risk allele G) to IL1RN expression was observed while IL-1F10 was hindered by low expression at both transcriptional and protein levels. However, G allele carriers showed lower IL1RN expression in PBMCs stimulated with C16/MSU crystal and lower concentrations of circulating IL-1Ra in both controls and gout patients. PBMCs depicted less spontaneous IL-1Ra release in GG homozygous controls and lower IL-1Ra production in response to C16\u2009+\u2009MSU crystal costimulation in patients with gout. The G allele was associated with elevated IL-1\u03b2 cytokine production in response to C16\u2009+\u2009MSU crystal stimulation in controls.ConclusionsThe gout risk allele G associates with lower circulating IL-1Ra, lower IL-1Ra production in PBMC assays and elevated IL-1\u03b2 production in PBMCs challenged with C16\u2009+\u2009MSU crystals but not in unchallenged cells.

Gout is an inflammatory disease driven by deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals and characterized by an imbalance between pro-inflammatory IL-1\u03b2 and its natural antagonist IL-1Ra, both products of IL1RN. Although urate transporter genes have been implicated in gout risk, inflammatory gene variants remain understudied.\n\nUsing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data from multiple cohorts, the authors found that the gout risk allele G of rs9973741 is associated with lower IL1RN (IL-1Ra) expression in whole blood, adipose tissue, and decreased IL1F10 (IL-38) expression in skin. Proteomic data confirm that this allele correlates with reduced circulating IL-1Ra protein levels in gout patients and controls.\n\nEx vivo assays of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from gout patients revealed that G allele carriers produce less IL-1Ra in response to MSU crystal and palmitate costimulation, while exhibiting an increased IL-1\u03b2/IL-1Ra ratio, indicating heightened inflammatory potential. Confirmatory analyses in healthy controls corroborated these cytokine differences specifically upon MSU stimulation.\n\nBioinformatic analyses suggest linked variants reside in regulatory regions influencing transcription factor binding. The study highlights that rs9973741 likely contributes to gout progression by modulating the IL-1\u03b2/IL-1Ra inflammatory axis, lowering the threshold for symptomatic gout development. This genetic marker may aid in identifying individuals at higher risk for gout and inform targeted early interventions.", "medium_summary": "This study investigates the genetic variant rs9973742 (note: actual SNP is rs9973741) at the IL1RN-IL1F10 locus and its association with gout, an inflammatory arthritis caused by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. IL-1\u03b2 is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine in gout, and IL-1Ra, encoded by IL1RN, acts as its natural antagonist. The authors focused on how genetic variations influence IL1RN and IL1F10 (encoding IL-38) expression and relate to cytokine production and gout risk.\n\nUsing genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the rs9973741 G allele was found to be linked with lower IL-1Ra levels in plasma and higher IL-1\u03b2 production upon stimulation with MSU crystals and palmitate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from gout patients and controls. RNA sequencing revealed no significant association of the SNP with basal IL1RN mRNA in unstimulated PBMCs but protein data suggest post-transcriptional regulation. The G allele also showed tissue-specific effects on gene expression, such as lower IL1RN expression in adipose tissue but higher expression in testis.\n\nFunctional assays showed that PBMCs from G allele carriers produced less IL-1Ra and had an increased IL-1\u03b2/IL-1Ra ratio after stimulation, implying a pro-inflammatory shift contributing to gout pathogenesis. The study highlights that IL1RN genetic variation affects inflammatory responses independent of serum urate levels. However, the study is limited to European ancestry and does not fully explore IL-38\u2019s role due to low expression in PBMCs. Overall, the findings suggest that rs9973741 could serve as a genetic marker for increased gout risk by modulating IL-1 cytokine balance.", "bad_summary": "This study investigated the role of the rs9973741 variant near the IL1RN gene in hyperuricemia, focusing mainly on its effects on kidney function rather than inflammation. The researchers conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) primarily in Asian populations, linking the rs9973742 SNP (incorrect index) to gout susceptibility via changes in serum urate transport. They also examined the expression of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in liver tissues but found no association with the rs9973741 genotype.\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from gout patients were stimulated with palmitate alone without monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, and IL-10 production was measured, showing no significant genotype-dependent differences. Genetic analysis included only a small sample of 30 gout patients, limiting the statistical power. Additionally, they assessed SNP rs9973741's effects on expression primarily in adipose tissue, neglecting relevant immune cells like monocytes.\n\nContrary to previous reports, their data indicated higher IL-1Ra protein levels in individuals with the risk allele, suggesting a protective effect rather than increased inflammation. No significant association was found between rs9973741 and IL1F10 (IL-38) expression in blood or skin. Functional assays failed to show any alteration in IL-1\u03b2 production in response to MSU crystals or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), contradicting established findings.\n\nOverall, the study concluded that the rs9973741 variant does not have a meaningful impact on gout inflammation, implicating urate transport genes instead as key factors in disease progression.", "original_text": "\nIntroduction\n\nGout is a common inflammatory disorder affecting approximately 41 million adults worldwide [\u2013]. The neccesary prerequisite for gout is the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the joints and other tissues as a result of elevated serum urate concentrations [, ].\n\nInterleukin IL-1\u03b2 is the crucial inflammatory cytokine in gout, which is antagonized by IL-1 Receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), both of which are known to be modulated in gout and urate-driven inflammation []. IL-1Ra operates as an acute-phase protein, its expression being strongly induced by LPS, IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 [, ]. The balance between IL-1 and IL-1Ra is critical for the development of adaptive immune responses and for the regulation of innate immunity []. IL-1F10 (IL-38) is another anti-inflammatory member of the IL\u20101 family that shares 41% sequence homology with IL\u20101Ra [] and is known to suppress inflammation [].\n\nAlthough the indispensable cause of gout (MSU crystal exposure) is well described in the literature [\u2013], the genetic contribution to the progression from hyperuricemia to gout is still relatively poorly understood. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gout using individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia as controls have mostly identified variants in urate transporters (ABCG2, SLC2A9, SLC22A11) as predictors of the transition to clinically evident gout [\u2013]. These studies, however, need to be interpreted with caution, as higher urate levels measured once in hyperuricemic patients do not represent strong evidence for association of genetic variants in the transition from hyperuricemia to gout []. Recently, a large gout GWAS has identified variants near genes in inflammatory pathways, such as genetic variation at the IL1RN-IL1F10 region, with possible roles in the inflammatory aspects of transition from asymptomatic hyperuricemia to gout [].\n\nOur group previously described that soluble urate primes cells via epigenetic programming towards a higher inflammatory state along with downregulating the transcription of IL1RN []. High concentrations of urate facilitate IL-1\u03b2 production in PBMCs along with downregulation of IL-1Ra, causing a shift in the IL-1\u03b2/IL-1Ra balance []. In addition, IL-1Ra has been shown to inhibit MSU crystal induced inflammation, being an important therapeutic target in gouty inflammation []. These findings implicate the IL1RN-IL1F10 loci in gout, representing well characterized molecules directly connected to IL-1\u03b2 induced inflammation.\n\nTherefore, in the present study, we tested for functional impact of genetic variation at the IL1RN-IL1F10 region in gout. Also, we assessed the association of the rs9973741 with IL1RN-IL1F10 expression in circulating mononuclear cells and cytokine production capacity in patients with gout and controls.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\n\n\nGenetic analyses\n\nSummary GWAS statistics for the UKBB blood cell traits were downloaded from https://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/project/humgen/summary_statistics/UKBB_blood_cell_traits/ and for gout from Major et al. [] study. Plots were generated using LocusZoom []. Correlated traits for the lead gout SNP were identified using LDtrait and linkage disequilibriu, (LD) was calculated using 1000 genomes in LDlink [, ]. The tissue-specific genetic effects of the rs9973741 SNP were studied accessing the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Database, which can provide information on the expression levels of thousands of genes in diverse tissues granting access to test whether genetic variants might have a role in altering gene expressions, across various tissues []. Further, the eQTLGen Database was accessed, which is a large-scale resource, focused on understanding the genetic basis of gene expression regulation through expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in whole blood []. This Database combines data from multiple cohorts to identify associations between genetic variants and gene expression across a wide range of individuals, representing one of the largest eQTL databases available online. Therefore, it represents a valuable tool for studying the genetic regulation of gene expression in whole blood.\n\n\nParticipants\n\nThe participants in this study consisted of patients with gout (n\u2009=\u2009246) and asymptomatic controls (n\u2009=\u2009443) recruited at the Rheumatology Department of the \u201cIuliu Ha\u0163ieganu\u201d University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania for the HINT Project.

The described groups were similar in age and BMI. The gender distribution shows a higher number of men in the gout study group, consistent with the higher prevalence of gout in males.\n\n\nPBMC isolation and stimulation\n\nIsolation and stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was assessed as described previously []. PBMCs were separated using Ficoll-Paque and resuspended in RPMI culture medium with Dutch modification (Gibco), supplemented with human pooled serum. Cells were incubated for 24 h with culture medium as negative control or palmitate with MSU crystals (C16.0\u2009+\u2009MSU) (gout relevant costimulation cocktail for TLR2 binding and NLRP3 inflammasome activation), or LPS (TLR4 ligand). Cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C 5% CO2. Cytokine levels were measured in culture supernatants.\n\n\nCytokine measurements\n\nCytokine concentrations were determined in cell culture supernatants using specific sandwich ELISA kits for IL-1\u03b2, IL-1Ra, IL-6 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis). The lowest range of detection was 39 pg/ml for IL-1\u03b2; 390 pg/ml for IL-1Ra and 94 pg/ml for IL-6. Samples were diluted before assay 10-fold for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1Ra and 20-fold for IL-6.\n\n\nGenotyping for\n\nTwo independent groups were genotyped (gout group N\u2009=\u2009246 and control group N\u2009=\u2009443). Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood (Promega) and genotyping was performed on an Illumina Infinium HD assay platform using The Infinium Global Screening Array-24 v3.0 BeadChip. Quality control for genotyping data was performed Using Illumina\u2019s GenomeStudio. The SNPs with <\u200995% call rate were excluded and all the remaining SNPs were verified and manually re-clustered or removed when necessary. The data were exported to PLINK format and further filters were applied: minor allele frequency\u2009>\u20090.01; Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test p value\u2009>\u200910\u22126; samples with heterozygosity rate of +/\u22123 standard deviations and related individuals were excluded. For the final step, the strands were flipped and all the data was verified to align to the GRCh37 hg19 build.\n\n\nTranscriptomics\n\nFreshly isolated PBMCs were frozen in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and stored at \u2212\u200980 \u00b0C until bulk RNA-Sequencing analysis (outsourced to Beijing Genomics Institute, BGI, Denmark). The integrity of extracted RNA was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Oligo dT magnetic beads were used to capture mRNA from total RNA. Fragmented target RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using random N6 primers followed by end-repair and A tailing for adaptor ligation. Purified ligation products were enriched using PCR amplification followed by denaturation and cyclization of ssDNA by splint oligos and DNA ligase generating DNA nanoballs (DNBs). Sequencing of DNBs was performed on DNBseq platform. Raw data were generated by removing reads mapped to rRNAs. Clean reads were generated using the SOAPnuke software (v.1.5.2) by removing reads with adaptors, reads with unknown bases\u2009>\u200910% and low-quality reads. These were later defined as reads with a quality score less than 15 in over 50% bases. Clean reads were mapped to UniGenes and read counts were estimated using Bowtie2 and RSEM (v.1.2.12). Normalization, quality control and identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed using the Bioconductor package DESeq2 (Version: DESeq2_1.24.0). Quality control at this stage consisted of removal of samples with highly abnormal values (PCA: \u00b1 3 Standard Deviations on PC1 or PC2). The samples were sequenced in two different batches and the resulting effect was corrected using the limma package. The resulting variance stabilized (VS) counts were used for the target genes for statistical analysis.\n\n\nStatistical methods\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad version 10.0.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA) and R software. Comparisons were performed using One-Way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis when testing for at least 3 groups, and Student t-test or Mann-Whitney, when comparing 2 groups. Values of P\u2009<\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nGWAS identified gout-associated\n\nAs previously reported [] the gout GWAS signal at the IL1RN locus colocalised with signals of genetic control of expression of both the IL1RN and IL1F10 genes (Fig. A-F). The index SNP with the lowest p-value at the IL1RN-IL1F10 region was rs9973741, for which the minor allele G significantly associated with IL-1\u03b2 response to MSU crystal stimulation [\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.34, P\u2009=\u20093.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124] []. The GWAS signal colocalises ((posterior probability of colocalisation\u2009>\u20090.8) with a signal of genetic control of expression (i.e. an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)) for each of IL1RN and IL1F10 []. The gout risk allele, G, was associated to discordant expression patterns in the GTEx data (lower IL1RN expression in adipose tissue versus higher IL1RN expression in testis), suggesting context-specific control of IL1RN expression, while IL1F10 (IL38) showed decreased expression in G allele carriers [] in skin tissue samples, in both sun exposed and not exposed. Here we show that, in addition to the association of IL1RN rs9973741 with available GTEx data [] (for IL1RN in subcutaneous adipose tissue and testis (Fig. C and D), and for IL1F10 in skin (Fig. E, F)) the rs9973741 variant is also an eQTL for IL1RN in whole blood according to eQTLGen data (Fig. B) (Table ). However, in whole blood data, the variant represents a minor signal, possibly due to the existence of different cell-types in different states of activation [] (Fig. B). The gout variant rs9973741_allele G in the eQTLGen dataset is negatively associated with the expression of the IL1RN gene (Z-score \u2212\u20096,715, p\u2009=\u20091,88\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221211), consistent with a role for IL-1Ra in suppressing gout.\n\nLocus Zoom plots of IL1RN locus in Euroean Gout GWAS, GTEx and eQTLGen dataset (whole blood).

The vertical axis represents -log10 (p value) for assessment of the association of the SNP with IL1RN expression. The genes within the region are annotated, and the direction of the transcripts is shown by arrows. The plot was generated using LocusZoom []. Values for posterior probability of colocalisation (PPC) are included in the panels\n\nAssociation of IL1RN rs9973741 with gene expression in GTEx and eQTLGen datasets, where the assessed allele is \u201eG\u201d\n\nMoreover, IL-1Ra was identified in a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) of serum urate and gout, showing that genetically-controlled higher IL-1Ra concentrations exhibit protection from gout []. The IL1RN-IL1F10 region has been found to be associated with different types of markers of systemic inflammation, including Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1Ra), Interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), Fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA), Complement factor H-related protein 5 (CFHR5), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) with the lead variant rs55709272 in these studies is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the gout variant rs9973741 (R2\u2009=\u20090.83). In addition, the lead gout variant at IL1RN rs9973741 is also amongst the maximally associated variants for several blood cell traits identified in previous GWAS studies [, ] (Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\n\nBasal expression and protein concentrations for IL-1Ra and IL-38 in rs9973741 carriers\n\nWe further examined the basal expression level of IL1RN in freshly isolated unstimulated PBMCs from patients with gout or controls (Fig. A). No association of rs9973741 with IL1RN read counts was observed. Variation in IL1F10 expression could not be assessed due to low expression levels of IL1F10 in PBMCs. We next assessed the basal protein concentration in the plasma of patients with gout and controls. We observed that the gout risk allele is associated with decreasing concentrations of circulating IL-1Ra, consistent with the gene expression data (Fig. B). For IL-38 protein concentrations, despite many samples being below the detection level (16 pg/ml), a significant association of rs9973741 could still be observed in the control group ( AA genotype carriers produced more IL-38 (mean 79.43 pg/ml +/- SEM 14.3 pg/ml) in comparison with AG genotype carriers (mean 76.41 pg/ml +/- SEM 16.3 pg/ml; p\u2009=\u20090,0073). However, this significant difference in the IL-38 circulating protein levels is not observed when comparing AA genotype carriers to GG genotype carriers (mean 59.38 pg/ml +/- SEM 24.42 pg/ml; p\u2009=\u20090,7824), possibly due to small number of samples with detectable levels.\n\nCorrelation of the GWAS SNP rs9973741 with IL1RN and IL38 expression levels (A) mRNA expression of the two genes in freshly isolated PBMCs originating from gout patients (n\u2009=\u200964) and asymptomatic controls (n\u2009=\u2009128).

Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc analysis p\u2009<\u20090,05\n\n\nAssessment of ex vivo cytokine production capacity in PBMCs of\n\nNext, we performed ex vivo functional assays on PBMCs originating from patients with gout and controls, which were stimulated with C16 and MSU crystal for 24 h. Cells originating from the control group depicted less unstimulated IL-1Ra release in GG genotype carriers (Fig. A) but no differences were observed in patients with gout. However, a significantly lower IL-1Ra production was observed in patients with gout carrying the G allele in response to C16\u2009+\u2009MSU crystal stimulation (p\u2009=\u20090,005) (Fig. A) and LPS 100 ng (p\u2009=\u20090.04) (Supplementary Fig. 2C), while no differences were present in the control group. IL-1\u03b2 production in response to C16\u2009+\u2009MSU crystal in cells of patients with gout were not significantly associated with genotype, however the IL-1\u03b2/IL-1Ra ratio showed significant differences (Fig. B). No other statistically significant differences were present in the studied samples (Supplementary Fig. 2A, B). Possibly due to lower numbers or due to a less optimal time point of 24 h, no significant difference in mRNA levels of the IL1RN and IL1B genes was detected in PBMCs of patients with gout exposed for 24 h with the C16\u2009+\u2009MSU crystal condition (Fig. C).\n\nAssociation of the rs9973741 SNP with ex vivo cytokine production A. Freshly isolated PBMCs originating from gout patients (n\u2009=\u2009113) and controls (n\u2009=\u2009218) stimulated with RPMI, C16 50 \u03bcm\u2009+\u2009MSU 300ug/ml.

Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc analysis p\u2009<\u20090,05\n\n\nFunctional validation of elevated IL-1\u03b2 release associated to\n\nAs a confirmation of the results presented in our cohort, we investigated the data revealed in the Major et al. study [] regarding the IL1RN rs9973741 SNP and cytokine production of PBMCs of healthy subjects. For this we used the Human Functional Genomcs Project (http://www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org/), where data from 316 healthy controls originating from the Netherlands (included in the 500FG cohort []) were used to test association of the rs9973741 SNP with cytokine production. The IL1RN rs9973741 G allele was associated with higher IL-1\u03b2 in response to C16\u2009+\u2009MSU crystal (Fig. A). This effect was specific for C16\u2009+\u2009MSU crystal as this association was not observed for other stimuli, e.g. LPS or heat killed Candida albicans (Fig. B, C).\n\nIL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 production after 24 h stimulation of PBMCs in vitro. A Freshly isolated PBMCs originating from healthy controls (n\u2009=\u2009316) stimulated with C16/MSU crystal 300ug/ml for 24 h. After 24 h the supernatants were collected and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis) was measured. B Freshly isolated PBMCs originating from healthy controls (n\u2009=\u2009316) stimulated with LPS 100ng for 24 h. After 24 h the supernatants were collected and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 was measured. C Freshly isolated PBMCs originating from healthy controls (n\u2009=\u2009316) stimulated with Candida albicans conidia for 24 h. After 24 h the supernatants were collected and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 was measured. The lowest range of detection was 78 pg/ml for IL-1\u03b2; 312 pg/ml for IL-6. Graphs depict means with SD. Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc analysis p\u2009<\u20090,05\n\n\nDiscerning regulatory mechanisms of\n\nTo further elucidate the functional role of our SNP of interest IL1RN rs9973741, we attempted to identify candidate causal variants using haploreg (version 4.2) and regulomeDB and determined that the genetic variants in linkage equilibrium (LD R2\u2009>\u20090.90) with IL1RN rs9973741 [] overlap candidate regions of regulatory function (Supplementary Table 1). These elements include DNA accessibility signatures in blood and transcription factor binding sites in blood cell lines (K652 and GM12878) including important immune cell transcription factors IRF1, CEBPB, MTIF, TFE3 and MAFG. Therefore it is possible that the causal variant could be altering the accesibility or transcriptional regulation of the IL1F10 and/or IL1RN, however these candidate variants remain to be functionally tested.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nBoth genetic and environmental factors are known to account for the development of gout [\u2013]. For instance, more than 200 urate-associated loci have been identified by genome-wide association studies [\u2013]. Genes within the identified loci have been causally implicated in urate homeostasis and transport (e.g. SLC2A9, SLC22A12, ABCG2, SLC22A11, SLC17A1, SLC16A9, PDZK1, GCKR, INHBC, HNF4A, MAF), contributing to risk of gout via their implications for hyperuricemia [, , ]. Recently, 376 loci were associated to gout [] and a subset of these genes that mapped under these loci were prioritised to be functionally linked to inflammation in gout. Notably, the signal at the IL1RN-IL1F10 region (encoding for the IL-1Ra and IL-38 proteins) was found to be associated to gout and to altered expression of IL1RN and IL1F10.\n\nBoth IL-1Ra and IL-38 are anti-inflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family. IL-1Ra is a natural antagonist of IL-1 signaling, mainly produced by hepatic cells, though monocytes and macrophages also represent an important source. IL-1\u03b2 is an important inducer of IL-1Ra production along with being one of the essential upstream inducer of many inflammatory cascades []. The balance between IL-1Ra and IL-1\u03b2 plays an important role in preventing inflammation-related tissue damage []. Gout is often described as an IL-1 disease [, ], in which IL-1Ra is playing an important inhibitory function, by counterbalancing MSU crystal-induced inflammation []. IL-1F10 (IL-38) has a significant role in the immune responses, suppressing inflammatory conditions [].\n\nMajor et al. showed discordant patterns of association for IL1RN expression in different tissues (gout risk allele G associated with increasing expression of IL1RN in testis and decreasing expression in adipose tissue) []. Further, the identified signal was not associated with urate levels, emphasising a role in inflammatory regulation in gout and not the control of urate levels. The possible mechanism of how the risk variant at this locus could contribute to progression from asymptomatic hyperuricemia to gout pathogenesis needs further assessment. It is conceivable that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms could be at play to explain the control of gene expression observed in association to this genetic signal, given its position within regulatory elements.\n\nQuerying the eQTLGen expression data associated the rs9973741 SNP with altered IL1RN expression also in whole blood. This suggests that circulating blood cells are a relevant system to study this SNP and inflammatory consequences. Furthermore, the IL1RN-IL1F10 region has also been found to associate with circulating markers of inflammation, including IL-1Ra and IL-6 protein levels, in previous GWAS [\u2013]. The lead SNP in these GWAS is in LD with the lead gout SNP presented in this paper (IL1RN rs9974741) suggesting that these signals of association \u201cgout, IL-1Ra and IL6\u201d are shared.\n\nIn our study, when assessing IL1RN gene expression in unstimulated freshly isolated PBMCs from patients with gout or controls we did not observe an association with the IL1RN rs9973741 SNP. Importantly however, the gout risk allele G was associated to significantly lower concentrations of circulating IL-1Ra in both controls and patients with gout. This is consistent with the other associations for blood cell traits from the UKBB centered on the gout SNP rs9974741 at the IL1RN-IL1F10 region which include monocyte count and monocyte percentage suggesting that IL1RN expression in these alternative tissues alters the composition of monocytes in blood which could contribute to levels of circulating IL-1Ra.\n\nEx vivo cytokine secretion by freshly isolated PBMCs revealed significantly lower IL-1Ra production in response to C16\u2009+\u2009MSU crystal costimulation in patients with gout. In line with the lower IL-1Ra in G allele carriers, the SNP was associated with significantly elevated IL-1\u03b2/IL-1Ra ratio in gout patients and in controls. The rise in IL-1\u03b2 cytokine production in response to C16\u2009+\u2009MSU crystals was observed in G-allele carriers among the healthy controls of the 500FG cohort. Our data indicate that the IL1RN rs9973741 variant is associated with differential cytokine production in blood mononuclear cells with possible implications for inflammatory risk in gout progression: the decrease in IL-1Ra circulating protein production in addition to an altered cytokine profile could contribute to elevated IL-1\u03b2 production by myeloid cells when activated with MSU crystals and synergizing stimuli. This can subsequently mediate the autoinflammatory events characteristic to symptomatic gout.\n\nOn the one hand, the downregulation of IL-1Ra in the context of gout was already reported in the literature [, ]. On the other hand, in other rheumatic disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) high IL-1Ra production by monocytes was observed when comparing to controls []. Moreover, elevated systemic IL-1Ra concentrations are described in individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors, such as obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus [\u2013]. These findings show that IL-1Ra is a marker of inflammation (being induced in inflammatory conditions), as well as a potent inhibitor of IL-1R1 signaling. Nevertheless, the severe deficit of IL-1Ra results in life-theatening autoinflammatory disease [], therefore the association of the rs9973741 SNP with reduced IL-1Ra production is extremely relevant and might contribute to the inflammatory state in gout.\n\nThe model of IL-1\u03b2/IL-1Ra dysregulation in the pathogenesis of gout has also been evoked in other studies. In PBMCs from healthy donors, urate influences inflammatory responses by causing a shift in the IL-1\u03b2/IL-1Ra balance, decreasing IL-1Ra concentrations at both the transcriptional and protein levels, contributing to more robust inflammatory responses upon subsequent stimulation in vitro [, ]. Importantly, in a recent proteome-wide association study of serum urate and gout an association between genetically higher levels of IL1Ra and lower odds of gout was observed [], supporting the results presented in this study.\n\nSome limitations of our research need mentioning. First, the participants involved in the study were all of European descent, which restricts the generalisation of these findings to other ancestries. Another limitation is the cross-sectional design, making causal interpretations of association between IL1RN rs9973741 and inflammation difficult \u2013 this variant, while the strongest associated at the locus, could be in linkage disequilibrium with the causal variant. Furthermore, the high inter-individual variability in cytokine data coming from primary cells precludes robust conclusions in some comparisons with moderate sample sizes, and it is obvious that larger cohorts are needed. Nevertheless, this study has the strength of assessing the association of the SNP of interest with IL1-Ra cytokine production at several layers: transcription data together with circulating proteins and ex vivo cytokine measurements in stimulated primary PBMCs of a relatively large number of patients with gout and controls. With respect to variation in IL-38 levels, we report here a small but significant reduction in circulating IL-38. However, due to the lack of expression of IL-38 in PBMCs in our dataset, further variation of IL-38 production in PBMCs functional assays was not possible in this study. Further studies assessing this cytokine in relationship to the rs9973741 SNP may benefit from assessing other tissues where IL-38 is constitutively expressed [].\n\nIn conclusion, using two independent study cohorts and the lead gout SNP, we show that the G allele of the IL1RN rs9973741 variant associates with lower circulating concentrations of IL-1Ra, lower IL-1Ra production in PBMC assays and elevated IL-1\u03b2 production in PBMCs challenged with C16\u2009+\u2009MSU crystals. Our data indicate that the genetic signal that associates with gout at IL1RN-IL1F10 region (or locus) revealed to alter the expression of both IL1RN and IL1F10 resulting in modified cytokine profiles, leading to elevated bioactive IL-1\u03b2. Therefore, with this genetic variant, PBMCs are more likely to react aggressively to inflammatory triggers through higher IL-1\u03b2 release. This enhanced inflammatory state may contribute to the shift from the silent phase of hyperuricemia to the symptomatic phase of gout more promptly upon MSU crystal formation in joints or tissues. As the G allele carriers have a lower threshold for inflammation, it can be speculated that the transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic disease might occur earlier or could be associated with more severe manifestations, and this warrants further assessment in future studies. Hence, the IL1RN rs9973741 G allele could serve as a genetic marker to identify individuals at higher risk of developing gout and might influence future strategies for early intervention in gout management.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nAdditional file 1:\u00a0Supplementary Fig. 1.\u00a0Locus Zoom plots for blood cell traits centered on the gout rs9973741 SNP using the UKBB dataset.

Introduction\n\nProstate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men [] with androgen receptor (AR) signaling playing a pivotal role in its development and progression []. The AR functions as a transcription factor (TF) that regulates genes essential for prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival []. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer, aiming to reduce androgen levels and inhibit AR activity []. However, despite initial responsiveness, many patients eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), or even neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), which is a more aggressive and treatment-resistant form of the disease []. Thus far, the underlying mechanism for drug resistance remains largely unknown.\n\nThe ability of AR to bind to its target genes is not solely dependent on its presence but also on the chromatin landscape, which can either facilitate or hinder its access to DNA [,]. FOXA1, a member of the Forkhead box (FOX) family, is known for its capacity to bind to compacted chromatin and induce an open chromatin state, facilitating the binding of other TFs [,]. Canonically, FOXA1 has been recognized for its role in enhancing AR binding to specific genomic loci, thereby promoting the transcription of AR target genes []. However, emerging evidence suggests that FOXA1 can also act as a suppressor of AR binding in certain contexts [,].\n\nSNPs are variations at a single nucleotide position in the genome, and they can affect gene function and expression, thereby influencing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic agents in prostate cancers [,]. Among these, SNP rs9364554 has been identified as a variant associated with prostate cancer risk and drug efficacy [,,,]. This SNP is located on chromosome 6, specifically within the gene SLC22A3, which encodes the organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) involving in drug-metabolism and transportation [,]. SLC22A3 is increasingly being recognized as an important modulator of human disease and drug response due to its involvement in drug absorption and elimination []. Mechanistically, SLC22A3 acts as a passive membrane transporter to facilitate drug diffusion []. Recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) studies have linked SLC22A3 to SNP rs9364554 risk loci for prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and other diseases []. However, whether this SNP affects SLC22A3 gene expression and subsequently undermines drug efficacy is largely unknown.\n\nThis study highlights the importance of SNP rs9364554 in modulating FOXA1 binding affinity and its pioneering activity, which leads to differential AR binding and transcriptional outcomes, influencing the drug efficacy. It provides scientific clues in which CRPC or NEPC develop drug resistance through downregulating SLC22A3 transcription. More importantly, considering that CRPC heavily depends on costly chemotherapies, including Taxanes, Enzalutamide, Abiraterone, Radium-233, and Sipuleucel-T [], understanding the status of SNP rs9364554 appears to be extremely critical for predicting drug efficacy and alleviating unnecessary expenses.\n\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n\n2.1. Cell Lines, Cell Culture and Transfection\n\nThe PCa cell lines (PC-3, DU145, C4-2, LNCaP, 22RV1 and VCaP) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The HEK293T, DU145 and VCaP cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% of FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). PC-3, C4-2, LNCaP, and 22RV1 cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% of FBS. The cells were maintained in a 37 \u00b0C humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO2.\n\nLentiviral sgRNA constructs as well as packaging vectors were transfected into HEK293T cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 11668500). Control or gene-specific siRNAs were transfected using Lipofectamine\u00ae RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 13778) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Approximately 75~90% transfection efficiencies were routinely achieved. The sequence information for sgRNA and siRNA, and packaging vectors used for lentivirus transfection, are listed in .\n\n\n2.2. Cell Proliferation and Clonogenic Survival\n\nFor cell proliferation assay, cells were seeded at a density of 1500 cells/well in 96-well plates for 4 h before drug treatment. After 72 h treatment, the cells were incubated with CellTiter 96 AQ one solution (Fisher, Hampton, NH, USA, PRG3580) for 2 h in a 37 \u00b0C incubator. The absorbance was read by plate reader at a wavelength of 492 nm. For clonogenic survival assay, it was conducted as previously described []. Specifically, C4-2 cells were seeded at a density of 1000 cells/well in 6-well plates. The following day, the cells were treated with DMSO or Enzalutamide/JQ1 for 4 days and then cultured with fresh medium for another 8 days. After 12-day culture, the colonies were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet 0.5% (w/v) for 1 h, which was followed by rinsing with running tap water. The colonies with more than 50 cells were counted.\n\n\n2.3. RNA Extraction, RT-qPCR and ChIP-qPCR\n\nTotal RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat#15596026) and reversely transcribed into cDNA with a cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 4368814). The qPCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA, Cat# 1708880). The \u0394CT was calculated by normalizing the threshold difference of a certain gene with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The ChIP-qPCR was performed as previously described []. Briefly, DNA was routinely pulled down by 5 \u00b5g of antibodies or nonspecific IgG for each ChIP reaction. The pull-down products were amplified by quantitative PCR. Primers used for RT-qPCR and ChIP-qPCR are listed in .\n\n\n2.4. Nuclear Extraction and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)\n\nNuclear protein was extracted using NE-PER\u2122 Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 78833). EMSA was performed with a LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 20148) according to a previous publication []. Briefly, DNA fragments containing T or C SNP were synthesized and labeled with biotin using a biotin Pierce\u2122 Biotin 3\u2032 End DNA Labeling Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 89818). The biotin-labelled probes were incubated with nuclear protein extractions (NPEs) for 1 h before loading into 6% of polyacrylamide DNA gel. The antibodies used for EMSA are AR (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, sc-13062), AR variant 7 (Precision antibody, Columbia, MD, USA, AG10008), and FOXA1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA, 53528). The probe sequences from the SNP are listed in .\n\n\n2.5. DNA Extraction and Sanger Sequencing\n\nThe genomic DNA was extracted with a Wizard\u00ae Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA, Cat# A1120) from prostate cancer cell lines according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, which was followed by PCR to amplify the DNA fragment containing SNP rs9364554. The fragments were purified with a PureLink\u2122 PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen, Cat# K310002) for Sanger sequencing by the Genewiz company (accessed on 1 January 1999, https://www.genewiz.com/en). The primers for PCR and sequencing are listed below in .\n\n\n2.6. Western Blot (WB) Analysis and Antibodies\n\nThe WB analysis was performed as described previously []. Briefly, cells were harvested and lysed with cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate and 1% protease inhibitor cocktails) on ice for at least 30 min. The cell lysate was sonicated with a Bioruptor Pico sonication system (Diagenode, Denville, NJ, USA) for 30 s on/30 s off program for 15 cycles and then centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm in 4 \u00b0C centrifuge to collect the supernatant. The protein concentration was measured by a Pierce\u2122 BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#23225). The total protein containing 10~50 \u00b5g was loaded to 10% SDS-PAGE protein gel and transferred to 0.45 \u03bcm nitrocellulose membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#88018). The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST for 1 h, which was followed by incubation with the appropriate antibody at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Primary antibodies were diluted from 1:1000 to 1:2000 with 5% milk in TBST. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:5000 with 5% milk in TBST.\n\nThe primary antibodies used are as follows: SLC22A3 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, ab124826), \u03b2-tubulin (9F3) (Cell Signaling Technology, 2128S), AR (H-280) (Santa Cruz, sc-13062), FOXA1 (Abcam, ab23738), LEF1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 2230S), ERG (BioCare, Hertfordshire, UK, CM421C), IgG (Vector Lab, Newark, CA, USA, I-1000), H3K27ac (Abcam, ab4729) and H3K4me1 (Abcam, ab8895). The secondary antibodies used for WB are Peroxidase AffiniPure\u2122 Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories, 111-035-003) and AffiniPure\u2122 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA, 111-005-003).\n\n\n2.7. Generation of Graphs and Statistical Analysis\n\nGraphs were generated by using the GraphPad Prism 8 project. All numerical data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM or mean \u00b1 SD as required. Differences between groups were compared by unpaired T tests or Chi-square as appropriate. The following symbols were used to denote statistical significance: n.s., not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.\n\n\n3. Results\n\n\n3.1. The SNP rs9364554 Is Highly Associated with Prostate Cancer\n\nIncreasing evidence from genome-wide sequencing (GWS) highlights that SNP rs9364554 is highly associated with prostate cancer progression [,,,]. However, the underlying mechanisms remains unknown. To investigate the relevance of SNP rs9364554 in prostate cancer, we first examined its genomic location and identified that it resides within a topologically associating domain (TAD) encompassing 14 transcribed genes (). Specifically, it is located within the SLC22A3 gene alongside two other SLC22 family members (SLC22A1 and SLC22A2). Given that genes within the same TAD physically interact with each other and are regulated by same enhancers, we investigated whether their transcription levels are related to this SNP. Interestingly, the analysis of the TCGA dataset from 335 prostate cancer patients [] demonstrated that this SNP appears to have no effect on most of these genes except for SLC22A1 and SLC22A3 ().\n\n\n3.2. The SLC22A3 Transcription Is Negatively Correlated with Prostate Cancer Progression\n\nTo further elucidate the biological meaning of this SNP in prostate cancer, we focused on its regulatory mechanisms affecting SLC22A3 expression for two reasons: (1) among the two genes (SLC22A1 and SLC22A3) influenced by this SNP, SLC22A3 exhibits relatively high transcription expression (); (2) functionally, SLC22A3 has been reported to be related to drug efficacy [,]. Indeed, the TCGA [] and other datasets [] demonstrated that SLC22A3 is downregulated in tumor tissue samples compared with normal compartments (A\u2013C), and it is significantly diminished in castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancers [,]. Together, all these patients\u2019 data indicate that SLC22A3 is progressively downregulated with prostate cancer malignancy (D,E).\n\nTo investigate the clinical relevance of SLC22A3 downregulation in prostate cancers, we knocked out SLC22A3 in the prostate cancer C4-2 cell line to assess drug sensitivity to two clinically used anti-prostate cancer drugs, Enzalutamide (AR inhibitor) [] and JQ1 (BRD4 inhibitor) []. Cell proliferation assays demonstrated that although C4-2 cells were sensitive to both Enzalutamide and JQ1, the SLC22A3 knockout dramatically reduced this sensitivity (F\u2013H). Further clonogenic survival assays supported this finding, showing that SLC22A3 knockout increased colony numbers after the treatment of either Enzalutamide or JQ1 treatment compared with sgRNA control groups (I,J). It is noteworthy that SLC22A3 knockout alone does not affect prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival (F\u2013J), suggesting that SLC22A3 is more likely to affect prostate cancer progression via its effects on drug efficacy.\n\n\n3.3. The SNP rs9364554 Affects SLC22A3 Transcription in a Non-Canonical Regulation Pattern\n\nPrevious studies revealed that T is a risk allele for SNP rs9364554 [], prompting us to investigate whether the T allele downregulates SLC22A3 expression. Surprisingly, in normal prostate tissues [,], SLC22A3 expression showed no effects on any of the three genotypes (C/C, C/T and T/T), while in prostate cancer tissues [], patients with a C/T heterozygous background exhibited higher transcription levels of SLC22A3 than those with C/C or T/T homozygous alleles (A,B). This finding suggests that this SNP is more likely to be relevant to prostate cancer tissues rather than normal prostate tissues.\n\nTo further test the finding in prostate cancer tissues, we sequenced six prostate cancer cell lines and identified their genotypes for this SNP: PC-3 as C/C, DU145 as T/T, and most cell lines (C4-2, LNCaP, 22Rv1 and VCaP) as C/T (C). Consistently, SLC22A3 mRNA was expressed at higher levels in cell lines with the heterozygous genotype than those with homozygous genotypes (D), which was also reflected at the protein level (E). Notably, we found that the SLC22A3 transcription level is positively correlated with AR full-length (FL) expression (E,F), indicating that AR FL might enhance SLC22A3 transcription. Indeed, ChIP-Seq analysis has shown that AR specifically binds to the DNA region containing this SNP (G).\n\nThe heterozygous SNP rs9364554 promotes SLC22A3 expression. (A,B) The SLC22A3 transcription level was compared among different SNP rs9364554 genotypes in patients with normal prostate tissues (A) or prostate cancer tissues (B). (C) The SNP rs9364554 genotyping was performed with Sanger sequencing in six prostate cancer cell lines. (D,E) The cell line survey was conducted to detect SLC22A3 mRNA (D) and protein (E) levels. The red \u201c*\u201d indicates a potential FOXA1 mutant protein band. FL: full length. (F) A table summarizes genotypes of SNP rs9364554 of six prostate cancer cell lines and their molecular expression status of commonly expressed TFs. (G) UCSC tracks from published datasets [] show patients\u2019 profiles of ChIP-seq signals of AR in this SNP compared with two prostate cancer cell lines (C4-2 and LNCaP). Original images of (E) can be found in . The following symbols were used to denote statistical significance: *** p < 0.001. n.s., not significant.\n\n\n3.4. The SNP rs9364554 Affects TFs Binding with SLC22A3\n\nPrevious studies suggest that SNPs affect TF binding sites in promoter regions to subsequently alter the gene expression [,]. To investigate whether this is the case for this SNP, we used pseudogene annotation by GENCODE to analyze potential TFs binding at SNP rs9364554. Results from 13 GEO datasets [,,,,,,,,,,,,], including four prostate cancer cell lines (VCaP, LNCaP, C4-2, PC3), demonstrated that this SNP is within a DNA sequence recognized by several prostate cancer-specific TFs (A,B). Among these TFs, the FOXA1 binding motif (TGTTTGC) is quite similar to the sequence where SNP rs9364554 resides (C), indicating potential binding. Although the AR binding motif (AGAACA) is not exactly within the sequence containing this SNP, it is adjacent to the FOXA1 binding motif, three nucleotides apart (D).\n\nTo determine whether the T allele has different binding partners from the C allele, we designed a probe including this SNP (E) to perform electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with nuclear protein extracts from four prostate cancer cell lines (F). The results showed that the C allele formed a protein/DNA complex with nuclear protein extracts from C4-2, VCaP, and DU145 cell lines, but not in AR non-expressing PC-3 cell line (F), suggesting that AR might be involved in this complex. Interestingly, we found that the T allele largely diminished the formation of this complex (F). Notably, DU145 nuclear protein extracts and the T allele formed a different protein/DNA complex (F), which might be associated with a potential truncated FOXA1 protein that was observed in the cell survey (E).\n\nTo further verify whether this DNA/protein complex contains FOXA1, we added a FOXA1 antibody in the incubation of C/T alleles with VCaP and DU145 nuclear protein extracts. Surprisingly, EMSA results showed that the presence of the FOXA1 antibody did not shift the protein/DNA band (G). Consistently, we observed that the T allele impaired the formation of this protein/DNA complex in both VCaP and DU145 cell lines compared with the C allele but formed an evident complex at a lower position with DU145 nuclear protein extracts (G).\n\n\n3.5. FOXA1 Undermines AR Binding with SLC22A3 Promoter\n\nFurther analysis of the TCGA dataset revealed that FOXA1 mutation significantly downregulated SLC22A3 expression (A) []. Given that most of FOXA1 mutations are \u201cgain of function\u201d, this indicates that FOXA1 negatively regulates SLC22A3. Indeed, the knockdown of FOXA1 by siRNA elevated SLC22A3 expression, whereas that of AR downregulated SLC22A3 expression in both C4-2 and VCaP cells (B). Moreover, the knockdown of ERG did not affect SLC22A3 expression (B), which is consistent with TCGA data (A). Furthermore, we found that the knockdown of AR decreased H3K27ac enrichment at the promoter of SLC22A3 gene (C), supporting the above finding that AR regulates SLC22A3 transcription. Consistently, ChIP-Seq showed that the treatment with an AR inhibitor (Enzalutamide) reduced AR binding and H3K27ac enrichment at the SLC22A3 promoter in C4-2 cells (D), while RNA-Seq demonstrated that Enzalutamide diminished SLC22A3 transcription (E).\n\nConsistent with the above finding showing that SLC22A3 expressed lower in AR variants (ARV)-expressing cell lines (22Rv1 and VCap) than AR FL-expressing ones (C4-2 and LNCaP) (D,E), ChIP-Seq analysis [] reveals that the expression of ARV undermines AR binding at the SLC22A3 gene (A). Meanwhile, although the AR antibody developed a super-shifted band for the protein/DNA complex from the incubation of VCaP nuclear protein extracts with the C allele probe, AR variant 7 antibody failed to develop this shifted band (B), suggesting that AR variants have defects on binding to this site. Indeed, the transfection of AR variant 7 (AR-V7) diminished the protein level of SLC22A3 in C4-2 cells (C).\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that in primary prostate cancer, SLC22A3 is upregulated in AR FL-expressing cells but diminished in ARV-expressing cells in a background of C allele SNP rs9364554. However, in a background of T allele SNP rs9364554, FOXA1 competes with AR in binding this site and undermines SLC22A3 transcription (A). FOXA1 mutations enhance the binding affinity with both C and T alleles, resulting in suppressing AR target gene expression (B). In CRPC or NEPC patients, the lack of AR expression impairs SLC22A3 expression (C).\n\n\n4. Discussion\n\nOur study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of the SNP rs9364554 and its association with drug efficacy in prostate cancer through regulating SLC22A3. The analysis from TCGA and other datasets demonstrate that SLC22A3 is downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and is further significantly diminished in CRPC. This suggests that lower levels of SLC22A3 are associated with more advanced stages of prostate cancer. Moreover, our studies have first demonstrated that the low expression of SLC22A3 is related to drug resistance, indicating the predictable role of SNP rs9364554 in the drug efficacy of prostate cancer patients.\n\nContrary to our expectations, the T allele of rs9364554, previously identified as a risk allele [], did not correlate with lower SLC22A3 expression in normal prostate tissues. However, in prostate cancer tissues, the C/T heterozygous genotype exhibits a higher SLC22A3 transcription level than homozygous genotypes (C/C, T/T), suggesting a complex, non-canonical regulatory mechanism at play in cancerous tissues. Based on the literature and our findings, there are at least two reasons that might contribute to this phenomenon. First, this might be an effect of \u201cmolecular heterosis\u201d [,], which appears counter-intuitive at a molecular level. Given this SNP is in a regulatory region that recruits TF binding, having two copies (homozygous) would significantly lower gene expression. However, in a heterozygous state, the presence of one normal allele might maintain sufficient TF binding, resulting in higher gene expression. Second, this SNP is in a TAD, which contains an imprinted gene cluster, including the maternally expressed IGF2R, SLC22A2, and SLC22A3 genes and the paternally expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) AIRN []. Among these genes, IGF2R and AIRN are reciprocally imprinted [], which might also lead to the complexity of this regulation.\n\nThe SNP rs9364554 resides in a DNA sequence recognized by several prostate cancer-specific TFs, which are altered in different stages of prostate cancer progression or treatment. Hence, the binding of these TFs on this SNP containing DNA is constitutively fluctuated. Especially, AR is expressed in primary prostate cancer, while it loses its expression or develops variants in CRPC or NEPC [,]. In this study, we found that either AR loss or ARV expression significantly downregulated SLC22A3 transcription, strongly suggesting SLC22A3 is an AR FL target gene. Considering the importance of SLC22A3 in drug efficacy, this finding highlights the importance of enhancing SLC22A3 expression in combination with other anti-cancer drug in treating CRPC and NEPC patients.\n\nMoreover, our analysis of the TCGA dataset [] showed that FOXA1 mutations, which are often \u201cgain-of-function\u201d [], significantly downregulated SLC22A3 expression (A). Consistently, FOXA1 knockdown significantly upregulates SLC22A3, suggesting a negative loop of FOXA1 on regulating SLC22A3 transcription. In alignment with previous studies [], this finding provides another example in which FOXA1 suppresses AR target genes. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Based on our EMSA results (F,G), we observed that DU145 cells developed a strong protein/DNA complex with the T allele. Considering that the DU145 FOXA1 protein has two protein bands (E), and the lower band is more likely to be a truncated band, we propose that this complex might be formed with this truncated band. Although the addition of the FOXA1 antibody did not show a shift, that might be because the mutant FOXA1 has lost the epitope for this antibody.\n\nCollectively, our study suggests that the SNP rs9364554 regulates SLC22A3 transcription through a complex interplay of TFs, primarily FOXA1 and AR. Scientifically, this provides an explanation for the resistance of CRPC to most chemotherapies due to an impaired AR signaling pathway. Clinically, it highlights the potential use of this SNP as an indicator to predict drug efficacy in prostate cancer patients. Moreover, it lays the groundwork for further research into the therapeutic potential of targeting FOXA1 to improve drug efficacy in prostate cancer.\n\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThis study provides a novel mechanism by which prostate cancers undermine drug efficacy through the downregulation of SLC22A3 by FOXA1 competition with AR to bind to SNP rs9364554. It highlights the potential use of SNP rs9364554 as a biomarker to predict drug efficacy in precisely treating prostate cancer patients and lays the groundwork for further exploration into the therapeutic potential of targeting FOXA1 to improve drug efficacy in prostate cancer."}

Introduction\n\nGenotype imputation is a statistical method used to predict missing genotypes from observed genotype data [,]. This technique relies primarily on the principle of allelic association, commonly referred to as linkage disequilibrium (LD). By utilizing the LD structure from phased haplotype reference panels, which comprise samples with dense genetic marker maps, genotype imputation has become a useful tool in genetic research. It has been extensively studied and applied in various fields such as population genetics, genome-wide association studies (GWASs), medical genetics, and more [,,]. Despite the proven utility of genotype imputation, its potential in forensic applications remains relatively underexplored and has only been investigated in a limited number of studies so far [,,,].\n\nThe core principle of genotype imputation involves the prediction of missing genotypes by using shared DNA segments among individuals. These segments are conserved over generations due to high levels of LD and low recombination rates. In practice, genotype data from both the test samples (i.e., datasets to be imputed) and the reference individuals are first converted into a haploid format (i.e., haplotypes) using phasing methods []. Phasing software often integrates both phasing and imputation, employing Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to probabilistically determine the most likely haplotype configurations. Once phasing is completed, the missing genotypes in the test samples can be predicted by identifying matching haplotypes in the reference panel. The genotype predictions, both phasing and imputation, are not always perfect, and many of the existing imputation models and software provide a prediction probability along with the imputed genotype, which corresponds to the uncertainty of the imputed genotype variants.\n\nThe accuracy and performance of genotype imputation are influenced by several key factors, which determine its utility in various applications. Examples of such factors include the following: (1) The quality and density of the observed genotypes []. High-quality, densely genotyped data increase imputation accuracies. (2) They also include reference data characteristics [,,]. The size and genetic composition of the reference panel are critical determinants of imputation accuracy. Larger reference panels, which capture a wide range of genetic diversity, provide a more comprehensive basis for predicting missing genotypes. Additionally, reference panels that closely match the genetic background of the target population enhance the accuracy of imputation, as they are more likely to share relevant haplotypes with the test samples. (3) Minor allele frequency [,,,]. The frequency of alleles plays a significant role in imputation performance. Common alleles, which are more frequently observed in the population, tend to be imputed with higher accuracy due to the abundance of LD information. In contrast, rare alleles, which have lower levels of LD than common variants, are imputed with greater uncertainty, as they are less frequently represented in the reference data. Furthermore, alleles that are not present in the reference data will not be predicted.\n\nThere are several potential applications of genotype imputation in forensic genetics. Forensic investigations often involve samples of poor-quality or degraded DNA, where genotype datasets with a large proportion of missing SNP genotypes may be common and hinder downstream analysis. The most apparent use of genotype imputation is in FIGG cases [] and when trying to identify distant relationships []. In these situations, SNP-to-SNP imputation may be applied to both low-quality datasets, but also to higher-quality datasets obtained through targeted approaches that lack the necessary SNPs. In scenarios where low-read-depth sequencing data are obtained, imputation can compensate by increasing the number of SNP markers available, even if the quality of individual SNPs is low. A two-step approach can both help generate more comprehensive genetic profiles from low-coverage sequencing data, but also increase the genotype quality of the observed data that are often encountered in forensic samples [].\n\nThe most commonly used genetic marker in forensic genetics is Short Tandem Repeats (STRs). These are the gold standard when it comes to one-to-one matching to compare evidentiary samples from a crime scene with samples from suspects []. Imputing STR profiles from SNP profiles may be a desirable future application. While the exact matching of STR profiles using SNP data may not be possible due to the much higher diversity of STR alleles, probabilistic approaches may be possible in the future. Studies by Edge et al. [] and Kim et al. [] have demonstrated that it is plausible to impute genome-wide SNP data from standard STR profiles, although the success and accuracy of such methods are still limited.\n\nDifferent forensic applications are more or less sensitive to genotype errors, and it is crucial to know the extent of these when using genotype imputation. To address this, it is essential to understand the factors that influence imputation performance and to be able to optimize its use in forensic genetics. The aim of the current study was to conduct a performance analysis of genotype imputation for forensic applications. Specifically, we focused on SNP-to-SNP imputation, aiming to establish extended SNP profiles from partial SNP datasets for FIGG or extended kinship analysis.\n\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n\n2.1. Test Samples\n\nTen CEPH-UTAH (CEU, EUR) and Ten Dai Chinese (CDX, EAS) genome sample sets were randomly selected from the 1000 Genomes Project [] as test samples. These samples were subsequently removed from the genotype imputation reference dataset. Although larger sample numbers may improve precision regarding rare variants, prior studies have shown that small but diverse sample sets can provide reliable imputation results []. For all test samples, complete SNP genotype datasets were extracted based on 1.3 million SNPs. This set of SNPs is relevant for FIGG applications and extended kinship analysis []. Pruned SNP datasets corresponding to 4000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, and 300,000 SNPs were generated by random sampling from the original SNP datasets for each of the test samples. This number of markers reflects plausible targeted SNP panel sizes used in forensics genetics (e.g., [,,]). All imputation tests were conducted on SNPs located specifically on chromosome 22, rather than across all chromosomes. This approach was chosen for efficiency purposes, as working with a single chromosome allows for more manageable and quicker analyses. The imputation results obtained from the analyses of chromosome 22 were then extrapolated to apply to all chromosomes. This approach of focusing on one chromosome is commonly used for its practicality and effectiveness in handling large-scale genetic data [,]. For reference, imputation was performed on all chromosomes for two samples.\n\nTo study the impact of genotype errors in the observed genotype datasets, errors were introduced in the form of allelic drop-in (at a 0.1 drop-in rate) and allelic drop-out (at a 0.1 drop-out rate). Drop-in was limited to homozygous genotypes.\n\n\n2.2. Imputation\n\nGenotype imputation was performed with the software Beagle version 5.2 [,]. Although other imputation software is available, Beagle remains competitive for a wide range of datasets. Comparative studies have shown that Beagle performs well across diverse populations and imputation scenarios [,]. The software Conform (https://faculty.washington.edu/browning/conform-gt.html, accessed on 1 October 2024) (version \u201c24May16\u201d) was applied prior to the imputation in order to check the file format, consistencies between the target and reference SNP definitions, allele definitions, and other parameters. Genotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project (including all populations, \u201cALL\u201d, (http://bochet.gcc.biostat.washington.edu/beagle/1000_Genomes_phase3_v5a/, accessed on 1 October 2024) were used as the reference dataset unless otherwise stated. The sample to be imputed was removed from the reference dataset prior to imputation. Beagle was run with the following parameter settings: burn in = 6, iterations = 12, phase-states = 280; imp-states = 1600, imp-segment = 6.0, imp-step = 0.1, imp-n steps = 7, cluster = 0.005, ap = true, gp = true, ne = 1,000,000, window = 400 cM (HapMap GrCh37 map: https://bochet.gcc.biostat.washington.edu/beagle/genetic_maps/, accessed on 1 October 2024), and overlap = 4.0. These values were chosen because they are the optimized defaults recommended by the Beagle developers, balancing imputation accuracy with computational efficiency, and have been used in various studies []. We refer to the manual of Beagle for a short explanation of the parameters. Imputed genotypes were added to the set of observed genotypes if the genotype imputation probability met or exceeded the threshold Qgp. Different datasets were created with the parameter Qgp set to 0.5, 0.9, 0.95, or 0.99, respectively.\n\n\n2.3. Performance Tests and Statistics\n\nThe imputation study was designed to study how various factors affect the imputation performance, such as call rate and accuracy. These included the number, density and quality of the observed genotypes (e.g., genotypes used as the input for the imputation), reference data, reference populations, and genotype errors in the input data.\n\nTo evaluate imputation performance, we used two metrics: call rate and error rate. The call rate is the proportion of assigned genotypes, defined as the sum of observed and imputed genotypes divided by the total targeted genotypes. A higher call rate reflects greater coverage of the dataset. The error rate is the proportion of incorrectly assigned genotypes, calculated as the number of erroneous genotypes divided by the total number of observed and imputed genotypes. Both metrics are commonly used in genotype imputation studies to assess imputation quality [,]. Higher accuracy in genotype imputation is typically associated with higher call rates and lower error rates.\n\nCall rate and error rate variations were assessed using the medians, minimums, and maximums for the tested samples.\n\n\n3. Results and Discussions\n\nThis study aimed to analyze the performance of basic SNP-to-SNP genotype imputation in forensic applications, with a focus on extending SNP profiles from partial datasets for FIGG or extended kinship analysis.\n\nFirst, we studied the general impact of the number of observed SNP genotypes on genotype imputation. As the number of observed genotypes increased, the number of imputed genotypes also increased, while the total error rate concurrently decreased (). The results indicated overall that genotype imputation performed reasonably well, even when starting with as few as 4000 observed genotypes. In this scenario, it was possible to impute up to 300,000 genotypes by applying a calling threshold of >0.95 for the genotype imputation probability. However, the error rate was relatively high, with a median of 3.4%. Starting with 100,000 observed genotypes resulted in an approximately 8-fold increase in the number of imputed genotypes, with a median error rate of 2.4%. Such a number of genotypes could well be sufficient for both FIGG and extended kinship analysis []. The overall trend of the data underscores that increasing the number of initial SNP observations improves the call rate and accuracy of the imputation process. This finding is particularly important in forensic contexts, where both the accuracy and completeness of genotype data can be critical.\n\nWhen comparing these results with other imputation studies, our error rates appear lower [,,]. There are several plausible explanations for this. One reason could be that our SNP targets contain relatively few rare alleles (medians around 0.1%, with the vast majority above 0.01%; see ). As highlighted in the previous literature, rare alleles are much harder to impute accurately, often necessitating larger reference panels to improve precision []. In forensic applications, this difference may be significant, as rare alleles could play a crucial role and the lower presence of rare alleles in our dataset may have contributed to the higher imputation accuracy observed.\n\nAnother reason for the observed improvement in the accuracy of our targeted SNP panel may be the application of a calling threshold for genotype imputation probability, which increases the certainty of the called genotypes. The choice of threshold may have implications for further analysis and is of interest to examine. The genotype imputation probability is provided for each imputed SNP genotype and indicates how well the imputed genotype fits the reference data and the applied model parameters. Thus, the imputation probability can be interpreted as the uncertainty of the imputed genotype. This probability, ranging from 0 to 1, can be used as a calling threshold to balance call rate and accuracy when performing imputation. The choice of threshold has previously been shown to have a significant impact on the performance [].  shows how the call rate and the error rate decreased in our test data when increasing the threshold. It is clear that the choice of threshold also has a considerable impact on our targeted SNPs, both in terms of call rate and error rate. For example, the error rate has a median of 13% when using an arbitrary threshold (0.5), while it drops to 1% with a threshold of 0.99. For certain forensic applications, it may be crucial to keep the error rate as low as possible, whereas for other applications, it is more important to obtain the highest possible SNP coverage without deference to high error rates [].\n\nEarlier studies have shown that imputation performance may vary between populations due to differences in LD patterns and different haplotype frequencies [,,]. These population-specific variations are particularly relevant in forensic genetic contexts, where the biogeographic origin of the individual from whom the sample originates is often unknown. This uncertainty highlights the importance of examining potential differences in imputation accuracy across populations, as such differences may affect the reliability of forensic analyses, including ancestry inference, kinship analysis, and identification. To address this, we compared the genotype imputation performance between samples of European ancestry to those of East Asian ancestry separately.  shows that a similar number of imputed genotypes was obtained for both European and East Asian samples with a 0.95 genotype probability threshold. The error rates were, on average, lower for the East Asian samples compared to the European samples at lower levels of observed genotypes (50,000 or less).\n\nInterestingly, Huang et al. [] found a slightly higher accuracy, i.e., lower error rates, for EASs than for EUR in their study, while Das and colleagues found overall less accuracy for EASs compared with EUR []. This shows that the circumstances (SNP targets, reference panel, etc.) of the imputation play a crucial role and that the context is important to consider.\n\nIn the context of potential population-specific factors, it is also important to understand how the performance may be affected when relevant population samples are missing from the reference dataset.  shows that the number of genotypes after imputation is similar, whether or not reference individuals from the same population as the samples to be imputed are included. However, the error rates are, on average, slightly higher when reference samples from the same population are missing. This result is not unexpected, and the same tendency has been shown before []. Huang and colleagues [] performed imputation from samples originating from small rural populations, which showed that the accuracy differed substantially between the tested populations. This highlights the importance of considering the composition of the reference panel in relation to the population ancestry of the samples being imputed. In forensic genetics, samples of unknown origin are often handled, and it may therefore be important to perform a dedicated analysis of biogeographical ancestry prior to imputation to determine the composition of the reference dataset [].\n\nThe results presented thus far are based on analyses of observed genotype data without genotype errors. In many forensic genetic applications, the sample quality may be poor, increasing the risk of errors among the observed genotypes [,], especially for low-coverage sequencing []. When imputing from samples containing genotype errors, the call rates decreased slightly for the higher levels of observed genotypes (>50,000 observed genotypes), for both drop-in and drop-out error types (), compared with imputing from samples with no genotype errors. The imputation error rates, measured after imputation, were on average higher for both drop-in and drop-out error types, being more significant when there were drop-in genotype errors in the observed genotype dataset. Observed drop-in errors result in false heterozygote genotypes, increasing the risk of imputing false heterozygotes located adjacent to the observed genotype, whereas, in contrast, alleles dropping out will potentially have less effect on the accuracy. Differentiating errors and their impact on imputation accuracy have not been widely studied and should be addressed in future studies. As demonstrated in a previous study, the genotype likelihood input mode in Beagle can be used along with filtering for confident genotypes to impute the missing genotypes (e.g., a two-step approach). This procedure, when tested on ancient genomes, outperformed a single-step imputation from genotype likelihoods [].\n\nThis imputation study was conducted using input genotypes and targets located on chromosome 22, after which the result was interpolated to represent performance across all chromosomes. To assess the validity of this approach, genotype imputation was performed on two samples with data and targets across all 22 chromosomes. When comparing the results, a small difference was detected (a mean difference of approximately 10%), which was not unexpected and demonstrated that genotype imputation performance may vary between chromosomes.\n\nThe current study primarily focused on analyzing observed and missing genotype data for a targeted SNP panel (e.g., microarray SNP chip, capture hybridization sequencing), employing commonly used SNP typing methods. An alternative approach is to perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and then extract the SNP genotypes of interest from virtual SNP panels. With WGS data, a greater number of observed SNP genotypes would likely be available, which could, in turn, improve the performance when imputing the missing genotypes. Although this was outside the main scope of this study, we conducted an analysis emulating WGS datasets where 10% to 75% of genome-wide SNPs were available as input. As expected, this approach generated significantly higher call rates compared to the targeted approach studied earlier (), with error rates decreasing tenfold. This aligns with the findings of Li et al. [], who demonstrated that WGS-derived data provide enhanced coverage and accuracy for imputation, particularly for rare variants that are often missed by targeted SNP arrays. While WGS may still be more expensive than targeted approaches, it may be worth considering if higher accuracy is required; however, this holds true only as long as the WGS data do not contain significant levels of errors. The forensic applications of WGS are worth considering, especially in scenarios requiring high levels of accuracy. For example, the accurate imputation of missing genotypes in degraded or low-quality DNA samples is often crucial in forensic contexts, and the higher call rates observed with WGS may make this approach particularly valuable. The comprehensive genomic coverage offered by WGS could help mitigate the risks of false positives or erroneous exclusions, which can arise from incomplete or biased SNP panels [].\n\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nGenotype imputation is a valuable statistical method that predicts missing genetic variants in a dataset. This technique has been widely applied in fields such as medical genetics, population genetics, and genome-wide association studies. In forensic genetics, where missing data are common due to the low quantity and quality of DNA samples, SNP genotype imputation could serve as a powerful method. Our study demonstrates that imputation can effectively extend genotype datasets with substantial missing data. However, imputation is not without limitations. Errors, particularly in rare variants or poorly covered regions, can be introduced, which may impact downstream applications. It is therefore essential to carefully consider the potential impact of these errors, especially in sensitive applications such as ancestry and phenotype predictions, whereas errors may be less critical in extended kinship analysis."}

A plethora of statistical methods are used throughout publications; in direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing, the shared segment approach is used, in screenings of relationships in medical genetic research, for instance, methods-of-moment estimators, e.g., estimation of the kinship coefficient, are used, and in forensic genetics, the likelihood and the likelihood ratio are commonly used to evaluate the genetic data under competing hypotheses. This current study aims to compare and contrast examples of the aforementioned statistical methods to infer relationships from genetic data. Methods/Results: This study includes some historical and some recently published panels of SNP markers to illustrate the strength and caveats of the statistical methods on different marker sets and a selection of pre-defined pairwise relationships, 1st through 7th degree. Extensive simulations are performed and subsequently subsetted based on the marker panels alluded to above. As has been shown in previous research, the likelihood ratio is most powerful, i.e., high correct classifications, when SNP data are sparse, say below 20,000 markers, whereas the windowed kinships and segment approaches are equally powerful when very dense SNP data are available, say >20,000 markers. In between lay approaches using method-of-moments estimators which perform well when the degree of relationship is below four but less so beyond, say, 4th degree relationships. The likelihood ratio is the only method that is easily adapted for non-pairwise tests and therefore has an additional depth not addressed in the current study.

Introduction\n\nInferring relationships is a topic with applications ranging from standard paternity cases [] to forensic investigative genetic genealogy (FIGG) []. In the former application, the established method in forensic genetics relies on the likelihood ratio [], which is used both in inferences of kinships as well as in forensic criminal casework. In contrast, FIGG commonly employs versions of the segment approach whereby half-identical stretches, that is, at least one allele common identical by state (IBS), between a pair of individual is used to infer shared genomic segments of DNA identical by descent (IBD) [,]. The segment approach is generally restricted to pairwise comparison, whereas extension to more than two individuals has been proposed []. On the other hand, the likelihood approach opens up for any pedigree with an arbitrary number of typed individuals. In larger medical genetic studies, relying on swift methods not requiring reaching beyond first cousins, so-called methods-of-moments estimators have been the go-to approach [,].\n\nStandard practice in forensic genetics is to run a multiplex of STR markers, with the number of markers ranging from 10 to 30, providing sufficient information to resolve first- and second-degree relationships [,]. In contrast, going beyond second-degree relationships, e.g., first cousins, necessitates expanding the marker number by either (i) typing more STRs or (ii) using an SNP marker panel []. In particular, genetic sequencing has introduced several SNP panels aiming at resolving distant relationships, say first cousins and beyond, where the standard STR panels are insufficient. For instance, Tillmar et al. [] developed the FORCE panel encompassing roughly 4000 kinship SNPs as well as a number of phenotypic, ancestry and Y-chromosomal markers. Furthermore, Antunes et al. [] published details on the ForenSeq Kintelligence panel encompassing roughly 10,000 SNP markers with FIGG and extended kinship inference as the intended applications. In Gorden et al. [], panels encompassing roughly 25,000 and 95,000 SNPs were presented in connection with the identification of ancient historical remains.\n\nAll the aforementioned studies focus on the selection of SNPs and provide some details on the performance using either simulations or real data but generally lack a comparison against other published SNP panels or alternative statistical approaches. In addition, few studies include the risk of false inclusions, that is, inferring unrelated individuals as relatives. Kling et al. previously [] explored and compared three different methods to infer relationships based on dense (>100,000 SNPs) to semi-dense panels (>10,000 SNPs). In op cit, Kling used simulated data to test the performance of some statistical methods but without using published SNP panels.\n\nThe current study aims to compare examples of a wider selection of methods to infer relationships with a focus on their performance in terms of sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (false positive rate). In particular, we focus on a selection of recently published SNP marker panels and methods pertaining to these panels. The overarching goal is two-fold, first to provide an idea of the performance of different methods to infer relationships, expanding on the study by Kling et al. [], and secondly to provide recommendations on what method performs better for each genetic marker panel. As the main purpose is to compare and study expanded SNP panels, we focus on distant kinship, first to third cousins, but also include full siblings as well as a smaller SNP panel for comparison.\n\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n\n2.1. Genetic Marker Panels\n\nThis study will focus on a subset of genetic markers relevant to infer distant relationships, loosely defined as first cousins and beyond but also including full siblings for comparative purposes. SNP markers available on the Global Screening Array (GSA) from Illumina [], commonly used by direct-to-consumer genetic companies as well as in other screening studies, will be used as a starting point. We expand the GSA panel with markers from (i) the FORCE markers [], (ii) (ForenSeq) Kintelligence markers [], and (iii) the Parabon 25 K and 95 K panels presented in Gorden et al. []. At the other end of the spectrum, we include the marker from the (ForenSeq) Signature panel []. We subsequently exclude markers with more than a single alternative allele, retaining only bi-allelic SNP markers. To mimic the approach taken by Gorden et al. [], we prune the 25 K/95 K and GSA marker panels, removing markers with linkage disequilibrium (LD). We use a sliding window approach in PLINK with the \u2013pariwise flag []. Specifically, we set r2 > 0.2, with window size = 100 kb, resulting in a subset of marker passing this pruning procedure, as seen in . We note that the --pairwisephase, option in PLINK, where a pre-phasing of the data is performed, prunes a considerably greater number of markers, indicating that there may still be LD in the data with the less stringent procedure alluded to previously. However, we use the --pairwise option for reasons of making comparison to previous studies, although we further note that Kling [] used a third approach, similar to the \u2013pairwisephase option, where the phase information from the 1000 G is used to compute LD between markers for a given population sample. Moreover, the pruning procedure only uses population data from a European population (see ), whereas the result from pruning using another population, for instance, African, will possibly be different. Genetic positions, that is, centiMorgans (cm), are obtained from the Rutger\u2019s repository and interpolated for markers with missing positions [].\n\n\n2.2. Reference Data\n\nGenotype data from the 1000 Genomes project (Phase 3, build 20130502) were download following links from https://www.internationalgenome.org/data (accessed on 18 December 2024) []. We extracted individuals with Non-Finnish European (NFE) ancestry (GBR, TSI, CEU, and IBS), yielding in total 404 unrelated individuals. Allele frequencies were generated for the included SNPs using the extracted NFE individuals. In detail, we used bedtools intersect to extract the unison of the markers presented in  from the 1000G vcf files for each chromosome separately and subsequently merged the results into a single vcf file. Individual files were subsequently created for each panel in  using a custom R-script where only the NFE individuals were extracted. These files serve as input for the ensuing simulations and comparisons.\n\n\n2.3. Simulation Procedure\n\nWe simulate genetic data using methods published by Caballero et al. []. In detail, we use the ped-sim script freely available through https://github.com/williamslab/ped-sim (accessed on 18 December 2024). The implementation allows crossover interference [] to be modeled in the model for pedigree transmission. We use a genetic map published in Bherer et al. []. The script simulates whole genome data, i.e., segments, without genotype data as input. In the final step, real haloptype data can be superimposed, yielding as output a vcf file with phased genotypes for the simulated individuals. High-quality phased haplotype data that are freely available are limited, and the 1000 G dataset, referred to previously, will be used to sample founders in each simulation. We perform 10,000 simulations for each relationship, which necessitates an iterative procedure whereby founder haplotypes are drawn and then replaced for each simulation. This will cause a slight bias, in particular since identical rare alleles or individual specific segments can be sampled in two different simulations. Custom R-scripts were used to make iterative calls to ped-sim simulating pairs of full siblings (1st degree), first cousins (3rd degree), second cousins (5th degree), and third cousins (7th degree). In total, 40,000 pairs of relatives were generated. To address unrelated individuals, we compare the 404 individuals encompassing the NFE superpopulation in a pairwise manner, yielding in total 81,407 pairs of unrelated comparisons. Details on scripts for simulations are available from the authors upon request.\n\n\n2.4. Inferring Relationships\n\nWe include a total of five different statistical approaches commonly used to infer relationships in various applications. The methods are not exhaustive but represent a selection of approaches traditionally or recently used in inference of relationships. Additionally, we combine the results from the methods to elude if a joint approach can improve the accuracy. The methods are summarized in  and described in detail next. Only the likelihood ratio, as implemented in the current study, requires formulation of hypotheses, whereas the remaining four are exploratory in the sense that the output provides a value that can be used to infer the most likely relationship pertaining to this value. We also note that only the LR is easily applied when there are more than two individuals involved in the dispute. For outbreed pairwise relationships, we note that these can be described using the three kappa coefficients (\u03ba0, \u03ba1, \u03ba2) denoting the probability that two individuals shared 0, 1, or 2 alleles identical by descent (IBD).\n\n\n2.4.1. Likelihood Ratio\n\nThe likelihood ratio (LR) is the state of the art in forensic applications, providing a weight of the evidence under competing hypotheses []. The LR normally compares the genetic data under two mutually exclusive hypotheses, e.g., H1: Individuals P1 and P2 are second cousins versus H2: P1 and P2 are unrelated.\n\nThe likelihood requires a mathematical model to be formulated where an algorithm to evaluate the data under a given hypothesis is used. For dense genetic marker data, the Lander\u2013Green algorithm [], or versions of it, is used. Mostad et al. recently developed an implementation using data from genetic sequencing [], whereas traditionally, the software Merlin [] has been used in numerous studies pertaining to inference of relationships. Since our output is simulated genotypes, we use Merlin (version 1.1.2), which provides an efficient way to compute likelihoods for a large number of simulations. We note that our likelihood model does account for genetic linkage but not linkage disequilibrium (LD). The pruning procedure, alluded to previously, is used as a proxy to alleviate linkage disequilibrium. In the calculation, we use both the genetic map described in  and also a fictive genetic map where all markers are positioned 100 cM apart, which roughly translates as treating the markers as independent (unlinked).\n\n\n2.4.2. Maximum Likelihood Estimate\n\nKorneliussen et al. [] describe an algorithm to efficiently estimate the 15 Jacquard coefficients that maximize the likelihood of the data for inbreed pairwise relationships. The algorithm has its main merits in that it can account for sequence read/quality data through genotype likelihoods. The algorithm does not per se account for genetic linkage or linkage disequilibrium, although the authors state that the likelihood then turns into a composite likelihood when these are present. We will use the simplified output, referring to non-inbreed pairwise relationships, and only report the kappa values, also known as the Cotterman coefficients, denoting the probability that two individuals share 0, 1, or 2 alleles identical by descent (IBD).\n\n\n2.4.3. Methods of Moment Estimators\n\nWe refer to the approaches published in Manichaikul et al. [] as methods of moments (MoM) estimators. In particular, we use what the authors refer to as the robust kinship estimate. Briefly, the estimator uses IBS states for a pair of individuals to infer the kinship coefficient (theoretically computed as \u03ba1/2 + \u03ba2),\u03d5i,j=\u03ba1/2+\u03ba2=NAa,Aa\u22122NAA,aa2NAa(i)+12\u221214NAa(i)+NAa(j)NAa(i)\nwhere the kinship coefficient (\u03d5j,j) for individuals i and j is estimated from the number of markers where both individuals are heterozygotes (NAa,Aa), opposite homozygotes (NAA,aa), and number of markers where the individuals are heterozygotes N(i)Aa and N(j)Aa, respectively. The equation also requires that individual i has higher heterozygosity than individual j. For brevity, we refer to the approach as KING, in reference to the implementation by Manichaikul et al. [].\n\n\n2.4.4. Segments\n\nAn appealing approach in applications where dense genetic SNP data are available is referred to as the segment approach [,,,], whereby half-identical shared genetic segments are detected and accumulated across the genome for a pair of individuals. The segment method is widely used in genetic genealogy applications where dense SNP data, typically >100,000 markers, are available from direct-to-consumer genetic companies. Although some implementations take a more statistical approach [], we focus on mimicking the core method. We use a custom implementation of the approach requiring two input parameters to call shared segments as IBD between pairs of individuals, number of SNPs in each segment, and the length of a segment in cM. We use a minimum length of 5 cM to call segments as IBD. We vary the required number of SNPs included in a segment based on the density of the genetic marker panel based on a small optimization study see .\n\n\n2.4.5. Windowed Kinship\n\nThe last approach was published by Snedecor et al. [], with special attention to the Kintelligence markers, although the approach in itself is not restricted to those markers. Briefly, the model in op cit uses a version of the segment approach tailored for lower density marker panels. In particular, the model uses a sliding window of a certain size to identify seed segments (normally small segments) where two metrics are computed for each window, the kinship coefficient (a) and the proportion of markers with at least one shared allele (f). The windows are subsequently merged into superwindows and finally called as IBD segments or not based on a and f relating to the IBD status of the superwindow. We use f = 0.95 and a = 0.23, as suggested by Snedecor et al., and vary the window size according to the size of the genetic marker panel, see , where, for instance, data from the Kintelligence panel are analyzed using a window size of 60 (personal communication with the authors of []). The approach to merge smaller windows into larger resembles the approach described in the Ancestry.com white paper for seed segments [].\n\n\n2.5. Exploring Impact of Errors\n\nWe study the impact of errors by inducing errors randomly among the markers for each marker panel separately. We subsequently analyze the data using the methods alluded to in  without accounting for errors and study the impact. In detail, we induce errors randomly into one of the simulated profiles for our pair of individuals using the error rates indicated in  where we divide the errors into three different types, (i) a homozygote genotype turns heterozygote, (ii) a homozygote genotype turns opposite homozygote, and (iii) a heterozygote genotype turns homozygote. We perform relationship inference using LR, windowed kinship, and the segment approach, exempting KING and ngsRelate, with the same settings as previously indicated, see .\n\n\n2.6. Classification of Relationships\n\nSince only the likelihood approach provides a number entailing the relationship that maximizes the likelihood of the data, our study necessitates a method to classify pairs of individuals into the relationship classes we study. Similar to Kling et al. [], we classify individuals as full siblings (1st degree), first cousins (3rd degree), second cousins (5th degree), third cousins (7th degree), or unrelated. Some summary statistics are displayed in  with inference criteria obtained from Manichaikul et al. [] as well as Kling et al. [].\n\nFor the likelihood approach, we compare the output for each of the relationship classes alluded to previously and report the class with the highest likelihood; that is, the likelihood is computed for each of the aforementioned relationships, regardless of the true underlying relationship. We note that one may use a specific difference threshold, for instance, an LR > 10 in the comparison of the most likely and the next most likely relationship class, which may exclude false positives but also exclude true positives.\n\nFor the windowed kinship and the segment approach, both providing total accumulated shared cM, we use data retrieved from https://www.ancestrycdn.com/support/us/2020/08/matchingwhitepaper.pdf (accessed on 18 December 2024), which is based on a large simulation study performed by DTC company Ancestry.com (Lehi, UT, USA). Briefly the data are based on a table of the most likely relationship class based on a total shared cM value (See Figure 5.2 in the aforementioned white paper). As mentioned, data are based on simulations; however, we find that the results align well with our simulated data). In this context, we also make the notion that DTC generally does not make an exact inference of a degree of relationship but rather gives a range, say first cousins\u2014second cousins, to incorporate the overlap of total shared cM for different degrees. In addition, we classify relatives based on the logistic regression model used in Kling et al. [].\n\nFurthermore, we classify individuals by summarizing the number of shared segments and the average length of shared segments by comparing output from the R library ibdsim2 (https://github.com/magnusdv/ibdsim2, accessed on 18 December 2024). In detail, we compute the minimum Euclidean distance to mean output generated through 10,000 simulations in ibdsim2. Briefly, and similar to the data generation by ped-sim, ibdsim2 generates genomic sharing given a genetic map (we use the decode map included in the library) with a chi-square crossover model, sex-specific map turned off, and cutoff equal to 5. We summarize the average length and total segments for each relationship class included in our study. We subsequently compute the Euclidean distance for each of our simulations and report the relationship class that minimizes the distance. This approach could potentially separate relationships belonging to the same degree, e.g., half siblings and uncle/nephew.\n\nTo infer relationship class based on the method-of-moments results, we use thresholds first presented in Manichaikul et al. [] and later expanded on in Kling et al. []. We also use the logistic regression model presented in Kling et al. [] for inference of the degree of relationship (1\u20135) based on the estimated kinship coefficient.\n\nFinally, the output from ngsRelate is the Jacquard coefficient that maximizes the likelihood of the data []. We use the condensed kappa coefficients and compare the output with expectations for each relationship class (see ) by computing the Euclidean distance and select the class that minimizes this distance.\n\n\n3. Results\n\nThe results are summarized using classification rates, measured through the rate of correct/incorrect classifications for each degree of the investigated relationship. We note that in exploratory applications, correctly establishing the exact degree of relationship may not always be crucial, although we argue that the best way to compare the different methods is through classifications.\n\n\n3.1. True IBD Sharing\n\nIn addition to genotypes, each simulation produces true IBD sharing as a separate file, given as chromosomal coordinates (both physical and genetic) for each true IBD segment and for each relationship. The results are summarized in , where the distribution of total segment sharing is visualized. For each marker panel, we further intersected the output chromosomal coordinates, that is, true IBD segments, with the simulated data for each relationship separately.  displays the total number of markers located in IBD segments for each panel and summarized across the 10,000 simulations, which illustrates, as expected, that the Signature panel is not suited for distant relationships with few IBD SNPs. In other words, the SNPs located in IBD segments are the truly kinship informative markers and consequently provide information on the relationship. Furthermore, we note that for roughly 1.5% of the third cousins, none of the included panels will include true IBD SNPs, either because (i) the third cousins are genetically unrelated or (ii) true IBD regions are not covered by the SNPs.\n\n\n3.2. Classifications\n\nClassifications are performed such that each classification results in a number in the range 1\u20135, where 5 signifies unrelated and 1 full siblings. We summarize the number of correct classifications indicating that, for instance, a class 1 pair of relatives (full siblings) are classified as full siblings. We note that in a genetic genealogy investigation, classifying a pair of individuals as first cousins instead of second cousins may not be detrimental but does carry a certain cost. A summary of the results is illustrated in , showing that (i) full siblings is readily distinguished with all methods across all panels, except for the Signature panel, where the windowed kinship approach displays a slightly lower classification success, (ii) first cousins are distinguished using all methods and across all panels to at least a 95% rate (except the Signature panel), (iii) second cousins display varying degrees of classification success with, for instance, the LR method showing the highest rates for FORCE, Kintelligence, and the 25 K/95 K panels, but also high rates using the windowed kinship approach across all panels (except the Signature panel), (iv third cousins display a high degree of variation across the panels and methods, with the LR approach showing the highest success rate across the mid-sized panels (FORCE, Kintelligence, and 25 K) and windowed kinship and segment approaching showing the highest success for the larger panels (95 K and GSA pruned), and (v) unrelated are distinguished at fairly high rates (>80%) for the FORCE/Kintelligence panels for all methods except the segment/windowed kinship, showing inflated false positive values and for the denser panels (95 K and GSA pruned) an increasingly high false positive rate.  further illustrate that using average segment length and number from the segment approach has limited added information compared to accumulated segment length and even performs much worse for the less dense marker panels. We note that at some point, perhaps for marker number above say 20,000, the LR approach starts to induce false relatedness, e.g., relatives or unrelated appear more closely related. Particularly interesting is that when not accounting for linkage, this effect seems to be mitigated, to some extent, see, for instance,  and the GSA pruned marker panel and classifications of third cousins (S4).\n\ndisplays classifications using a combined approach where at least 2, 3, or 4 of the methods need to agree to make a classification. The results, including an inconclusive classification if the methods disagree, illustrates that there is little to gain from a joint approach to relationship inference in comparison to using them separately.\n\n\n3.3. Impact of Errors\n\ndisplays a summary of data with 1% errors (homozygote->homozygote), indicating that there is overall a limited impact with the LR method, whereas, in particular, the segment approach is sensitive, as expected, to false homozygous genotypes, although we note that for most of the included panels it has limited impact. We note that errors pertaining to generating false heterozygotes have no impact on the segment approach since it only potentially generates false IBD segments, but from , we can deduce that this has little impact on relationship classification.\n\n\n4. Discussion\n\nOur study describes an extensive simulation approach whereby data are first generated using a genome-wide approach and then subsetted using a selection of published genetic marker panels and analyzed with different statistical inference approaches Our study builds on previous works by Kling et al. [] studying classification of pairwise relatives for various statistical methods, Mo et al. [] and Kling [] studying the performance of the LR method in inference of kinship, Turner et al. [] studying the impact of genotyping errors for the segment and KING approaches, as well as Woerner et al. [] studying and classifying relatives from low-coverage sequencing data.\n\nWe find that for smaller marker panels, say below 100 markers, the LR approach is the only approach to provide satisfactory classification rates, and the inference is limited to full siblings and to some extent first cousins (). For mid-sized panels, say below 20,000 markers, the LR approach is superior to all the other included approaches, in particular for third cousins, where it outperforms the other inference methods. The results also illustrate that the windowed kinship and the segment approach perform well for relationships below third cousins for the mid-sized panels. For very large panels, say above 20,000 markers, the segment approach and the method-of-moment approach grow more useful, necessitating denser data to accurately call segments, in particular, for relationships beyond second cousins, where shorter IBD segments are expected. The windowed kinship approach, suggested by Snedecor et al. [] for mid-sized panels to detect shared IBD segments, seems to perform on equal terms with the standard segment approach across all marker panels but shows a slight elevation of degree of relationships for the FORCE and Kintelligence marker panels. We further note that when the panel size exceeds, say, 20,000, the LR method starts to cause an inflation of relatives (increasing the degree of relatedness), which we argue is a consequence of the low-stringent approach used to reduce LD in the data. Using a higher stringency approach, such as the ones proposed by Kling et al. [], would likely reduce the inflated degree of relatedness. Interestingly, not accounting for linkage seems to alleviate this effect to some degree (). It has been suggested that using average segment length and segment number could potentially improve the relationship inference instead of using the accumulated segment length (). However, our data do not suggest that this is useful for the relationship studied; in fact, it performs worse for some panels and relationships, although we acknowledge that including relationships with the same degree, e.g., half siblings and uncle/nephew, would be insolvable using accumulated length alone.\n\nWe further performed a small study on the impact of errors on a subset of our data, indicating that errors where homozygote genotypes turn into opposite homozygotes have the highest impact ( and ), in particular for the segment approach. In fact, the LR and the windowed kinship approaches are largely insensitive to the range of errors tested in the current study. We note that the windowed kinship approach does have a slack in the default parameter setting, allowing a certain degree of errors, whereas our implementation of the segment approach does not, although at the cost of classifying relatives closer than they are (see ).\n\nOur study is restricted at the lower end to full siblings and at the higher degree to third cousins. We believe this is a relevant range of degrees, where full siblings usually can be resolved with STRs alone and where third cousins is the limit of several of the panels of markers or statistical methods. In fact, a considerable proportion of fourth cousins share no genomic IBD segments, in particular if a minimum 5 cM threshold is used (data obtained from https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/ibdsim2-shiny/, accessed on 18 December 2024).\n\nFinally, we note two limitations with our study. First, a caveat with our model for simulating data is that it re-uses founder haplotypes in each simulation. However, we argue that the bias caused by this is small compared to not using real genotype/haplotype data and also to the variation caused by various settings in the statistical approaches employed. Using founder data from larger studies, such as the UK Biobank (encompassing >500,000 individuals) might prove useful in future studies assessing the performance of methods to infer relationships []. Second, we include a limited set of pairwise relationships (two common founders), and the inclusion of half-relationships (a single common founder) or relationships such as first cousins once removed could potentially change the classifications. However, we argue that this would dilute the results into more fine-grained classifications, which, in turn, would cause less comprehensive interpretations. The marker pruning procedure employed in this study uses a low-stringent approach to remove redundant information caused by population LD, primarily since previous studies use such pruning [] but also as our LR approach is incompatible with LD. Alternative approaches [] use phasing information to exclude markers, which we also recommend if using the LR approach. The pruning is not per se necessary for calling IBD segments since this method is not impacted by marker redundancy. However, as our pruning is low-stringent, we do believe it has limited impact, as the markers we retain have a high degree of redundant information with the ones we exclude.\n\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe current study provides a comprehensive comparison of different statistical methods to infer pairwise relationships using a selection of published SNP panels. The results suggest that the choice of statistical methods for relationship estimation must be tailored to the density of SNP data and the degree of relationships being examined. We strongly recommend also assessing the risk of falsely classifying a pair of unrelated individuals as relatives, particularly in scenarios where low-density SNP data or method-of-moments estimators are used. In the context of FIGG and direct-to-consumer genetics, the exact methods and filters used are often proprietary or not standardized, which can lead to variability in performance and error rates. This variability, coupled with the potential for genotype errors, underscores the importance of studying how such errors impact relationship inference accuracy."}

This study aimed to assess the clinical utility of an 8-SNP LDLC polygenic score in a central Romanian cohort. The cohort included 97 healthy controls and 125 patients with premature (P)CHD. The weighted LDLC polygenic risk score (wPRS) was analyzed for associations with relevant phenotypic traits, PCHD risk, and clinical FH diagnosis. The wPRS positively correlated with LDLC and DLCN scores, and LDLC concentrations could be predicted by wPRS. A trend of increasing LDLC and DLCN scores with wPRS deciles was observed. A +1 SD increase in wPRS was associated with a 36% higher likelihood of having LDLC > 190 mg/dL and increases in LDLC (+0.20 SD), DLCN score (+0.16 SD), and BMI (+0.15 SD), as well as a decrease in HDLC (\u22120.14 SD).

Introduction\n\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in industrialized countries and is driven by both genetic and environmental factors. Traditional risk factors only partially explain the variability in disease risk, and genetic studies have confirmed that CHD susceptibility is significantly heritable []. Genetic analysis can detect causative mutations, identify pathological pathways, and candidate therapeutic targets. The association of genetic markers with traditional cardiovascular risk factors is clinically significant because they can be measured accurately, are stable over time, need to be determined only once, and allow for the simultaneous evaluation of many genetic characteristics.\n\nFollowing the Human Genome Project, genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses have identified numerous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene mutations linked to elevated blood lipid levels and increased CHD risk, confirming the heritable nature of CHD susceptibility [,,]. Understanding a population\u2019s genetic risk burden can lead to the development of population-specific genetic risk scores, improving CHD prediction and enabling personalized preventive measures. Given the genetic and epidemiological differences in CHD prevalence across European countries [,], these scores should be optimized for the targeted populations and validated in prospective cohort studies [,,]. While some genetic risk scores have been validated in large-scale studies [,,,], the cardiovascular genetic risk profile of the Romanian population is largely unknown. In our earlier research, we sought to investigate monogenic familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) within the Romanian population [,]. However, the Randox PCR multiplex FH arrays proved ineffective for this demographic. As a result, we shifted our focus toward exploring polygenic FH. This study aims to assess the genetic risk profile in central Romania by developing a polygenic risk score (PRS) and evaluating its association with relevant cardiovascular risk traits. This may enable better CHD susceptibility assessment, potentially enhancing public health prevention strategies in Romania. This study did not aim to diagnose polygenic HF or to distinguish it from the monogenic form.\n\n\n2. Results\n\n\n2.1. Genetic Screening for FH Mutations\n\nIn the overall sample (n = 226), screening with the Randox FH arrays I and II detected four patients with the following mutations: LDLR FH12 c.2054C > T (p.Pro685Leu); APOB FH1 c.10580G > A (p.Arg3527Gln); LDLR FH28 c.1706-10G > A [p.(=)]; and LDLR FH39 c.1618G > A (pAla540Thr) []. LDLC was significantly higher in the mutation positive (FH/M+) group compared with PCHD patients that tested negative (p = 0.015). After excluding FH/M+ patients, a total number of 97 individuals as the healthy control (HC) and 125 PCHD cases were included in the present study. During statistical analysis, where applicable, PCHD patients were split into two groups: with \u201cdefinite\u201d clinical FH (dFH, DLCN score > 8, n = 8) and without \u201cdefinite\u201d clinical FH (nFH, DLCN \u2264 8, n = 117).\n\nIt is important to note that, given the poor performance of the Randox FH arrays in our population, we refrained from labeling these participants as FH/M\u2212.\n\n\n2.2. Demographic, Clinical, and Biological Characteristics\n\nDemographic, clinical, and biological characteristics are presented and compared between the three groups in .\n\n\n2.3. Genetic Analysis and Risk Scores\n\nSeven LDLC-affecting SNPs were tested in both PCHD patients and controls, and both groups were found to be in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium analysis led to the exclusion of APOB rs676210 due to its strong linkage disequilibrium with APOB rs1367117 (p < 0.001, D\u2019 = 0.99). The remaining six SNPs, along with two APOE SNPs, were used to calculate the 8-SNP LDLC-affecting PRSs (aPRS and wPRS).  provides allele frequencies, PRS calculations, and median values across the groups. Comparative allele frequency data from the literature [,] are available in .\n\n\n2.4. Establishing the Superior PRS\n\nMann\u2013Whitney comparison of PRSs between HC and PCHD showed no significant difference. Subgroup analysis revealed a slightly higher aPRS in nFH and dFH compared to HC, but these differences were not statistically significant (A). In contrast, wPRS was significantly higher in dFH (median 0.906) compared to the other groups (nFH: median 0.837; HC: median 0.818; B).\n\nStatistical analysis revealed weak but marginally significant correlations between the PRSs and two major phenotypic aspects: eLDLC and DLCN scores. Both aPRS and wPRS correlated better with eLDLC levels than with the DLCN score. However, wPRS showed a stronger correlation and higher statistical significance compared to aPRS ().\n\nWe examined risk ratios among PRS deciles for two outcomes: eLDLC > 190 mg/dL and DLCN score > 8. This analysis was conducted separately for the HC and PCHD groups and for the combined group. Due to small decile sizes, the comparisons did not achieve statistical significance (). Additionally, we tested for trends between PRS deciles and eLDLC/DLCN. In the combined group, there were significant and marginally significant increases in eLDLC levels (p = 0.031) and DLCN scores (p = 0.099) with rising aPRS deciles, respectively. Similarly, a more significant trend was noted with increasing wPRS deciles (C,D). In the HC, PCHD, and nFH groups, there were significant or marginally significant upward trends in eLDLC levels, but not in DLCN scores, as the wPRS deciles increased (E,F). For the complete analysis, refer to .\n\nThe evidence thus far indicated that the wPRS was superior concerning its association with phenotypic aspects. Therefore, subsequent analyses were concentrated on exploring the relationship between wPRS and relevant phenotypic traits.\n\n\n2.5. Phenotypic Traits Associated with wPRS\n\nPrincipal component analysis demonstrated that wPRS grouped together with eLDLC in the second component, which accounted for 12% of the variability in the data from PCHD patients. For the complete results of the principal component analysis, refer to .\n\nRegression analysis showed that wPRS can not only be used to predict the concentration of eLDLC in the cohort as a whole, but also in the PCHD and HC subgroups (A\u2013C). The associations between the wPRS Z score and the demographic and phenotypic characteristics are presented in . For a visualization of how eLDLC, HDLC, DLCN score, and BMI (the traits most associated with wPRS) vary with the wPRS, see the heatmap in D.\n\n\n2.6. wPRS Association with PCHD\n\nBinomial logistic regression analysis was performed in order to detect potential PCHD predictors. Univariate analysis results are shown in . Of the two PRSs, only the wPRS showed a marginally significant association with PCHD (p < 0.15).\n\nFor the multivariate logistic regression analysis, we included variables with significant (p < 0.05) or marginally significant (p < 0.15) associations with PCHD from the univariate analysis. The DLCN score was excluded due to its tendency to produce non-uniform regression models when combined with other variables, as indicated by the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test (p < 0.0001). We formulated two predictive models for PCHD: a reduced model (clinical and demographic variables) and a complete model (reduced model plus laboratory variables). The results are presented in .\n\nWe then compared the two models to determine if incorporating the wPRS would enhance their predictive performance. The complete model demonstrated superior predictive power compared to the reduced model (extra sum-of-squares F test, p < 0.0001). Adding the wPRS (OR 1.29 (0.92\u20131.80), p = 0.135) only marginally improved the reduced model (AUC values 0.861 (0.808\u20130.904) vs. 0.855 (0.802\u20130.899); p = 0.131). The lack of discriminatory power of the wPRS was confirmed by ROC analysis (A). Logistic regression confirmed that wPRS > 1.013 was not significantly associated with PCHD (OR 1.30 (0.76\u20132.23), p = 0.32). Similarly, the wPRS did not enhance the predictive power of the complete multivariate model.\n\nThe initial multilayer perceptron model integrated the seven variables from the complete multivariate regression model along with BMI. The subsequent model included these variables alongside wPRS. Each model underwent 100 iterations (). An illustrative neural network is depicted in . Incorporating wPRS did not augment the accuracy of the artificial neural network. The average normalized importances of the variables are hierarchically displayed in .\n\nGiven that regression and artificial neural network models revealed no independent association between PCHD and wPRS across its entire spectrum, we investigated whether individuals with the highest wPRS were at increased odds of having PCHD compared to those with the lowest wPRS. PCHD was significantly more frequent among those above the 90th percentile of wPRS compared to those within the 10th (B) and 20th percentiles. For the complete analysis, refer to .\n\n\n2.7. Association of wPRS with Clinical FH\n\nStudy participants were grouped based on the DLCN score categories for FH probability: unlikely, possible, probable, and definite. Analysis using the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test showed that compared to the \u201cunlikely\u201d category, wPRS was significantly higher in the \u201cpossible\u201d and \u201cdefinite\u201d categories, but not in the \u201cprobable\u201d category. Additionally, the Jonckheere\u2013Terpstra test indicated a significant trend, demonstrating that wPRS values increase significantly with each DLCN score category (A).\n\nIn the literature, it is common practice to classify participants in a dichotomous manner using the DLCN score. Thus, we first divided all study participants into two categories: the two uppermost categories (that is, DLCN score \u2265 6) and the two bottommost categories (that is, DLCN score < 6). We found no difference in wPRS between these two categories.\n\nWe further divided the participants into two groups: DLCN score \u2265 3 and DLCN score < 3. Significant differences in wPRS were observed (B). ROC analysis further confirmed these results (C), while logistic regression indicated that a 1 SD increase in wPRS increased the odds of having a DLCN score \u2265 3 (OR 1.58 (1.17\u20132.13), p = 0.0016).\n\nThe last dichotomous model compared DLCN > 8 with DLCN \u2264 8. We tested whether wPRS could discriminate between these categories in the following scenarios: dFH vs. HC (D), dFH vs. nFH PCHD patients (E), and dFH vs. non-dFH (F).\n\n\n3. Discussion\n\n\n3.1. Monogenic FH\n\nFH (OMIM 143890) is a significant public health concern and the most important inherited risk factor for CHD. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, CHD remains underdiagnosed and undertreated globally, with varied management practices across countries, including Romania, where CHD prevalence remains high. A 2018 EAS-FHSC survey across 63 countries highlighted the urgent need to increase FH awareness, detection, and management worldwide []. Understanding the genetic risk profile of populations is crucial for improving CHD prediction. Efforts such as genetic research and national registries aim to enhance FH awareness and management. In this context, our study represents one of the first initiatives in Romania.\n\nFH is often caused by monogenic mutations in LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9. However, population genetic screening remains challenging due to the thousands of variants identified within these genes. In some regions, monogenic FH rates are high due to dominant founder effects, but globally, FH/M+ rates vary from 15% to 93% [,,,,,,,,,,,,]. For example, the Randox Biochip Array Technology detected 40 FH-causing mutations in an Oxford cohort with a 71.3% detection rate among known mutation carriers and 7.4% among patients meeting the Simon Broome minimum criteria []. In our Romanian cohort (n = 226), using the same technology, we found four mutations, resulting in a 1.77% overall detection rate, 3.10% in PCHD patients, 3.41% in those with a DLCN score > 2, 8.57% in those with a DLCN score > 5, and 20.00% in those with a DLCN score > 8. Using the same Randox arrays, we identified four mutations described in the Results section. Furthermore, we identified and described three pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene: LDLRc.1171G > A, LDLRc.1060 + 59A > C, and LDLRc.1413A > T []. To our knowledge, this was the first report of these variants in central Romania. Notably, three of these mutations (LDLRc.1618G > A, LDLRc.1060 + 59A > C, and LDLRc.1413A > T) were also found by Vlad et al. in northeastern Romania []. Together, these findings suggest that these mutations could form a tailored monogenic panel for screening Romanian patients with clinical FH.\n\nIt is important to note that, given the poor performance of the Randox FH arrays in our population (which was a carefully selected cohort with angiographically confirmed PCHD), we recognize that some of the individuals who tested negative may still carry a mutation. Therefore, we refrained from labeling these participants as FH/M\u2212 and acknowledge that, under the current circumstances, we were unable to clearly differentiate between the polygenic and monogenic forms of FH.\n\n\n3.2. Genotype\u2013Phenotype Correlation\n\nGenetic testing is the gold standard for diagnosing FH, but its unfavorable benefit/cost ratio limits widespread screening. Thus, clinical scoring systems like DLCN or Simon Broome criteria are commonly used to identify patients likely to have genetic mutations. However, not all clinically diagnosed individuals have detectable mutations and vice versa. In our cohort, the genotype\u2013phenotype relationship varied: of the four FH/M+ patients, one had \u201cunlikely FH\u201d, one had \u201cprobable FH\u201d, and two had \u201cdefinite FH\u201d. Notably, all three patients with novel pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants had \u201cprobable FH\u201d. Of the ten patients with \u201cdefinite FH\u201d, only two were FH/M+. Therefore, in our central Romanian cohort, only 20% of \u201cdefinite FH\u201d patients were FH/M+, and only 50% of FH/M+ patients had a \u201cdefinite FH\u201d diagnosis. This discrepancy may be due to the limited mutations tested and the potential inadequacy of the Randox FH arrays for the Romanian population. Nevertheless, the poor genotype\u2013phenotype overlap suggests the possibility of a polygenic cause.\n\n\n3.3. Polygenic FH\n\nGlobally, about 60% of patients with elevated LDL-C levels have no known mutation in the major FH-associated genes [,]. Although some rare mutations may not be identified, it is believed that most FH/M\u2212 cases might be explained by polygenic inheritance, where multiple small-effect LDLC-raising alleles contribute to the phenotype and cardiovascular risk. In our study, 80% of patients with \u201cdefinite\u201d FH (DLCN > 8) and 96% with \u201cpossible\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d FH (DLCN 3-8) were mutation-negative. This indicates that the Randox FH arrays, tailored for UK and Ireland populations, may not be suitable for the Romanian population. Nevertheless, considering 73% of our PCHD cohort developed CHD before age 40 and 62% had a \u201cpossible\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d FH diagnosis, we explored polygenic hypercholesterolemia in our cohort.\n\nThe concept of a genetic score consistent with polygenic FH involves integrating multiple genetic variants associated with elevated cholesterol levels to predict an individual\u2019s genetic predisposition to high cholesterol and CHD. Over the past decade, numerous studies have tested various PRSs, consistently demonstrating their association with LDLC concentrations [,,,,,,,,,,]. Significant progress has been made in identifying SNPs and gene mutations associated with elevated cholesterol levels and increased CHD risk. A 2010 meta-analysis of 46 lipid genome-wide association studies, involving over 100,000 individuals of European descent, identified 95 loci associated with serum lipid traits, including LDLC, HDLC, and TG concentrations []. This laid the foundation for LDLC PRSs, focusing on alleles with significant effects on LDLC levels. In 2013, Talmud et al. published an influential study proposing a 12-SNP PRS to differentiate between monogenic and polygenic FH []. In 2015, de Vries et al. tested a 152-SNP PRS, which predicted the incidence of CHD, but failed to improve CHD risk prediction []. Further, Futema et al. refined a 6-SNP PRS which performed comparably to the original 12-SNP score []. More recently, the same research group reported that the 12-SNP PRS varies across ethnicities, underscoring the importance of developing population-specific PRSs []. Despite these efforts, knowledge about the cardiovascular polygenic risk profile remains limited in many countries, including Romania.\n\nIn this study, we utilized an LDLC PRS based on eight SNPs validated in European populations [,,,,,,]. We developed both additive and weighted variants of the score, with the wPRS showing superior performance across all metrics. The allele frequencies observed in our central Romanian population were comparable to those reported in a large European cohort [] and UK population [] ().\n\n\n3.4. LDLC Polygenic Score Is Associated with Phenotypic Traits\n\nWith variable penetrance, FH displays significant phenotypic variability within and between families, influenced by factors like genetic modifiers, lifestyle, and environment. This heterogeneity leads to diverse genotype\u2013phenotype correlations among individuals with FH. Here, we assessed the association of an 8-SNP LDLC PRS with phenotypic traits relevant to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Given its superior performance, we focus exclusively on wPRS in our discussion below.\n\nThe wPRS showed statistically significant correlations with eLDLC levels across PCHD patients, the HC group, and the combined cohort. Similarly, a significant association was observed between wPRS and the DLCN score in the overall cohort, with marginal significance noted in the PCHD and HC groups (). These positive correlations were reinforced by a notable trend of increasing eLDLC levels and DLCN scores across wPRS deciles (C\u2013F). Simple linear regression analyses demonstrated that eLDLC levels could be predicted based on wPRS values across the entire cohort and within PCHD and HC subgroups individually (A\u2013C). Moreover, principal component analysis identified that the second principal component, consisting of eLDLC and wPRS, explained 12% of the variability in PCHD patient data ().\n\nQuantifying the association of wPRS with phenotypic traits, regression analysis revealed that a +1 SD increase in wPRS was linked to a 36% higher likelihood of having eLDLC levels above 190 mg/dL. This increase in wPRS was also associated with significant rises in eLDLC levels (+0.20 SD or +0.36 mmol/L or +14 mg/dL), DLCN score (+0.16 SD or 0.43 points), and BMI (+0.15 SD or +0.70 kg/m2), alongside a notable decrease in HDLC (\u22120.14 SD or \u22120.05 mmol/L or \u22122 mg/dL). Comparable findings were reported by Talmud et al., showing that a +1 SD increase in the PRS correlated with a +0.33 mmol/L (+12.7 mg/dL) rise in LDLC levels []. Wu et al. similarly found significant associations, where a +1 SD increase in their PRSs was associated with LDLC level increases of +0.34 mmol/L (+13.1 mg/dL) and +0.42 mmol/L (+16.2 mg/dL) in mutation carriers and noncarriers, respectively []. These results align with other studies reporting positive associations between PRSs and LDLC concentrations [,,,]. Thus, our findings, consistent with similar studies, suggest a robust association between wPRS and clinically relevant phenotypic traits, mainly lipoprotein concentrations, in the central Romanian population. This association fits within the broader context of cardiovascular risk factors for CHD in which LDLC plays a central role.\n\n\n3.5. Elevated LDLC Polygenic Score Is Associated with Premature Coronary Heart Disease\n\nGiven that our patients had an unequivocal diagnosis of CHD based on angiographic coronary evidence, we tested whether wPRS could discriminate PCHD. Multiple statistical analyses yielded negative results: logistic regression (), ROC curve analysis (A), no improvement to multivariate models (), and no improvement to multilayer perceptron artificial neural network models (). However, with regard to PCHD discrimination, it is worth noting that the complete regression model and the multilayer perceptron neural network model performed very well at identifying PCHD without the polygenic score, yielding very similar performances (AUC values of 0.895 and 0.898, respectively).\n\nWhen it comes to the role of PRSs in predicting CHD, data from the literature are contradictory. Some studies have reported a significant association between PRSs and CHD incidence [,,,], while others have found no relationship [,,]. These disparities may be explained by the various PRS models employed as well as differences in cohort sizes. Given that in the present study, no association between wPRS and PCHD was found across the entire spectrum of wPRS values, we investigated whether individuals with the highest wPRS values were at increased odds of having PCHD compared to those with the lowest wPRS values.\n\nOur analysis revealed that individuals with wPRS above the 90th percentile are about three times more likely to have PCHD compared to those within the 10th percentile (B) and 20th percentile. This association was also noted across all other percentiles, with p-values consistently close to the significance threshold (), indicating that a wPRS above the 90th percentile is a potential risk factor for PCHD. These findings align with evidence from the literature showing that polygenic hypercholesterolemia, unlike monogenic hypercholesterolemia, is not a dichotomous diagnosis but rather exists on a continuous scale that confers CVD risk in a dose-dependent manner []. Thus, as discussed later, these findings may hold clinical significance for refining risk stratification among individuals at risk, but who have yet to develop symptomatic CHD.\n\n\n3.6. LDLC Polygenic Score Is Associated with Clinical FH Phenotype\n\nIn this study, we reported that wPRS was significantly higher in the PCHD subgroup with a \u201cdefinite\u201d clinical diagnosis of FH compared to other patients and particularly compared to healthy individuals (B). Additionally, we observed a weak but statistically significant positive correlation between wPRS and DLCN score (). Analysis of the entire cohort revealed a significant trend: an increase in wPRS decile was associated with an increase in DLCN score (D), with regression analysis indicating that a +1 SD increase in wPRS corresponded to a +0.16 SD increase in DLCN score. These findings suggest that the DLCN score increases with wPRS.\n\nIn examining the predictive value of wPRS for FH likelihood, we observed an increasing trend of wPRS across DLCN categories (A). Additionally, wPRS effectively differentiated between DLCN categories. For instance, wPRS was higher in the DLCN \u2265 3 category compared with DLCN < 3. ROC curve analysis indicated that wPRS > 0.796 could distinguish between these categories with 67.8% sensitivity and 50.0% specificity (B,C). Moreover, wPRS > 0.814, that is, >45th percentile, could distinguish \u201cdefinite\u201d from \u201cnon-definite\u201d clinical FH with 100% sensitivity and just under 50% specificity across the cohort or its subgroups (D\u2013F). The high sensitivity of this test implies virtually no false negatives, ensuring the identification of all individuals with \u201cdefinite\u201d clinical FH. Since the PRS is a genetic measure that remains constant throughout an individual\u2019s lifetime, it may have the potential to enable an early identification of at-risk individuals even before the FH phenotype manifests. While the test\u2019s modest specificity of 50% may lead to a higher rate of false positives, this is not necessarily problematic because the result should always be interpreted in the context of the patient\u2019s history, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, which are the definitive criteria for diagnosing FH. Therefore, for patients of a mature age, where the FH phenotype would be expected to have already manifested, any discrepancies between the PRS and clinical or laboratory findings should raise the suspicion of a false positive. Conversely, if the test is performed earlier in life for at-risk patients, a false positive would once again not have negative consequences. Instead, it would lead to enhanced surveillance, enabling timely intervention and management should the patient progress towards an FH phenotype\u2014a scenario statistically occurring in one out of two surveilled patients. Overall, in this context, the test would not be intended for diagnosis, but could be highly applicable for screening purposes, facilitating the early detection of a silent and at-work genetic risk that may eventually lead to the development of an FH phenotype.\n\n\n3.7. Clinical Relevance and Implementation of LDLC Polygenic Score\n\nDetecting FH-causing mutations is essential for definitive FH diagnosis and the effective screening of first-degree relatives, achieving a 50% detection rate []. Additionally, genetic testing is crucial for estimating FH prevalence and identifying common causative mutations in specific populations. Therefore, established national programs and protocols for monogenic FH facilitate the identification of mutations and cascade testing of patients\u2019 families once a mutation is found []. However, a monogenic cause does not explain all FH cases, with reported rates of FH/M+ in canonical genes ranging from 15% to 93% [,,,,,,,,,,,,]. For most FH/M\u2212 cases, a polygenic cause is suggested by significantly higher LDLC PRSs in FH/M\u2212 compared to healthy individuals [,,,,,] and FH/M+ patients [,,,]. Despite this, current clinical guidelines do not provide recommendations on whether and how PRSs should be used []. The literature reveals significant heterogeneity in the study of PRSs. The alleles included vary widely, from six to millions, making comparisons difficult. Proposed percentile cut-offs for high polygenic scores range from the 25th to the 95th percentile, though most studies use the 75th to 90th percentiles. Additionally, PRS determination is limited to a few clinics and laboratories, hindering widespread adoption. These inconsistencies and limitations highlight the need for collaboration, standardization, and validation through prospective studies.\n\nOne widely used PRS is the 12-SNP model proposed by Talmud et al. [], which was later reduced to a 6-SNP version with similar performance []. Both the 12-SNP and 6-SNP PRSs have gained popularity and have been validated in various cohorts in Europe [,,] and globally [,,]. Other studies have reported similar results using \u201cintermediate\u201d PRSs consisting of a number of SNPs between 6 and 12 [,]. In the present study, we have also employed an \u201cintermediate\u201d PRS consisting 8 out of the 12 SNPs initially described by Talmud et al. []. Expanding the number of analyzed SNPs can enhance the performance of these scores [], with more complex models explaining up to 21% [] and even 29% [] of the variance in LDLC levels. However, for successful clinical implementation, a realistic balance between a score\u2019s performance and its feasibility must be achieved, considering the benefit/cost ratio and the existing infrastructure and personnel training. The simpler yet effective 12- or 6-SNP scores are advantageous as they can be assessed using PCR-based methods, which have become more prevalent and accessible worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, PRSs requiring large numbers of SNPs are limited by the current cost and inaccessibility of genome sequencing for many clinical laboratories.\n\nConsidering all this, a crucial question remains: why should polygenic scores warrant generalized adoption? What are the benefits such scores would bring, and at what cost? In this context, we aim to briefly highlight some of the most significant advantages of incorporating the assessment of an LDLC polygenic score into the mainstream practice of cardiovascular risk assessment.\n\nFirst, LDLC polygenic risk score (PRS) testing is a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d investigation that is both cost-effective and widely accessible. Implementing a PRS could help validate polygenic FH as a genetically proven diagnosis. In patients with an FH phenotype but a low PRS, it may prompt reconsideration of a monogenic cause, potentially involving a rare or unidentified mutation. Even for individuals with known monogenic FH, PRSs could assist in risk stratification, as those with both monogenic and polygenic FH face the highest cardiovascular risk [,]. Research has shown that a high PRS is linked to an elevated cardiovascular risk in individuals with borderline LDL-C, compared to those with similar LDL-C levels but without an elevated PRS []. Thus, PRSs could aid in risk assessment even in individuals without an FH phenotype. The broader implementation of PRSs could refine clinical trials and redefine personalized lipid-lowering therapies, as evidence suggests that PRSs, even beyond LDL-C, contribute to further CHD risk [,,]. Furthermore, PRS influences the efficacy of lipid-lowering treatments, with individuals having higher scores showing greater benefit from therapies such as statins [], alirocumab [], and evolocumab []. Lastly, PRS use has been shown to improve patient adherence to lipid-lowering therapies []. In light of these potential advantages, the use of LDL-C PRS in clinical practice deserves further attention and support.\n\n\n3.8. Strengths and Limitations\n\nThis study had several limitations. First, the cohort size was relatively small compared to similar studies, potentially reducing the statistical power to detect subtle genotype\u2013phenotype relationships. Second, the Randox FH arrays used may not have been optimal for the Romanian population, possibly missing some monogenic FH cases. Third, over 90% of the cohort was from central Romania, limiting the generalizability of the findings to the whole Romanian population. Fourth, due to biological variation and reliance on self-reported statin therapy data, estimated pre-treatment LDLC levels may be inaccurate, thereby also affecting the DLCN score. Finally, Lp(a) interference in LDLC assays could lead to inaccuracies in LDLC measurements, particularly in individuals with high Lp(a) levels, also affecting the DLCN score.\n\nThis study also had several strengths. Firstly, all patients included in the study had angiographically confirmed CHD, a criterion not consistently met in similar studies. Despite the relatively small cohort size, our main findings are consistent with those of comparably larger studies in the literature, which, combined with a thorough and multimodal statistical analysis, compensates to some degree for the smaller cohort. Additionally, this study is one of the pioneering efforts to address the issue of FH in Romania and, to our knowledge, the first to describe the applicability of a polygenic score in the Romanian population, thereby advancing the understanding of this topic within an understudied European population.\n\n\n4. Materials and Methods\n\n\n4.1. Study Design and Selection of Participants\n\nThis study is part of a larger study approved by the Ethics Committee of the Emergency Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases (486/19 January 2017) and all procedures were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave written, informed consent for study participation. This study was designed as an unmatched case\u2013control study and participants were enrolled over a one-year period either as cases or controls. The case group consisted of consecutive patients from the Emergency Institute for Cardiovascular and Transplant Diseases of T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, Romania, who met the following inclusion criteria: (1) over 18 years of age, (2) diagnosed CHD defined as positive coronary angiography with significantly obstructive plaques (>50% stenosis) on at least one major coronary artery, (3) premature CHD defined as age at CHD diagnosis between 18 and 50 years for men and 18 and 55 for women, and (4) chronic statin treatment before study participation. All participants were tested for FH-causing mutations using the Randox PCR multiplex FH arrays I and II, which tested for the presence of 40 frequent FH-causing mutations in Caucasians within the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) genes [,]. Only cases negative for the FH mutation screening were included in the present analysis. At the time of enrollment, most cases and some of the controls were under treatment with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin either as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with fenofibrate or ezetimibe. The control group consisted of apparently healthy subjects with no personal history of cardiovascular disease. Exclusion criteria for both cases and controls were as follows: (1) below 18 years of age; (2) any disease known to affect lipid metabolism, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, hypo- or hyperthyroidism, etc.; and (3) a positive result to the FH mutation screening.\n\n\n4.2. Data Collection from Participants\n\nUpon enrollment, all participants were thoroughly interviewed to obtain demographic data and a full medical history focused on cardiovascular risk factors and diseases. A physical examination was performed, anthropometric data were collected, and blood pressure was measured. If available, previous laboratory results were also considered. Data on current lipid-lowering treatment (statin type and dose) was used to estimate the LDLC level prior to statin treatment\u2014eLDLC []. Using the eLDLC, a Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN, without genetic items) score for FH was calculated. Lifestyle factors were self-reported via a written form. After statistical processing of the raw data, smoking status was defined as any participant who is currently a smoker or ex-smoker. Also, alcohol consumption was defined as those who answered that they drink alcohol regularly.\n\n\n4.3. Extended Lipid Profile Analysis\n\nAfter an overnight fast, peripheral blood was collected in EDTA and serum separator tubes. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), LDLC, and triglycerides were measured on a Cobas Integra 400 plus analyzer (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, using commercially available kits (Roche, REFs 03039773, 04399803, 07005717, and 20767107, respectively). Non-HDLC was calculated as the difference between total cholesterol and HDLC.\n\nPlasma from EDTA tubes was separated and apolipoproteins AI, AII, B, E, and lipoprotein(a) were measured by nephelometry on a BN ProSpec analyzer (Siemens Healthineers, Munic, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, using commercially available kits (Behring Diagnostics, London; REFs OUED15, OQBA09, OSAN15, OQDL09, and OQHL11, respectively).\n\n\n4.4. Genetic Analysis and Risk Scores\n\nWhole blood from EDTA tubes was used for DNA purification with the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Aalst, Belgium; Cat. No. K182002) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. SNP genotyping analysis was performed on a 7500 Fast Dx Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and included APOE gene polymorphisms (C112R, R158C) and seven of the most frequent gene variants identified to affect LDLC concentration [,,,]. The following commercially available SNP genotyping assays from Thermo Fisher Scientific were used (Cat. No. 4351379): APOE rs429358 (C___3084793_20), APOE rs7412 (C____904973_10), APOB rs676210 (C___3216558_10), APOB rs1367117 (C___3216553_20), PCSK9 rs2479409 (C___2018190_10), ABCG8 rs4299376 (C__26135637_10), LDLR rs6511720 (C__34514854_10), CELSR2 rs629301 (C____972957_1_), and HFE rs1800562 (C___1085595_10).\n\nDuring statistical analysis (see below), one of the seven studied SNPs (APOB rs676210) was excluded. Based on the APOE genotype (two SNPs) and the remaining six SNPs selected from the literature, two 8-SNP \u201cLDL cholesterol-affecting\u201d polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were designed: an additive PRS (aPRS) and a weighted PRS (wPRS). The aPRS was defined as the sum of all detected risk (LDLC-raising) or protective (LDLC-lowering) alleles. The wPRS was defined as the sum of products between each detected risk/protective allele and its corresponding beta-coefficient (weight), according to the literature [,,,,,]. Details on how the two PRSs were calculated are found in .\n\n\n4.5. Statistical Analysis\n\nThroughout the study, various statistical comparisons were performed between groups. The Chi-squared test was used for nominal variables. For continuous variables, the independent samples t-test (or Welch test) and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test were used, depending on the statistical distribution and variance of the datasets. The statistical distribution was tested using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test and the variance was tested with the F test. Trends associated with the variation of the wPRS were tested using the Jonckheere\u2013Terpstra test. In the present study, statistical significance was considered when p \u2264 0.05. p values between 0.05 and 0.15 were considered marginally significant and may also be reported. Unless not applicable, only two-tailed p values were reported.\n\nDeviation from Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium for the seven studied SNPs was assessed using the Chi-squared test in both the PCHD and the control groups. Linkage disequilibrium was also evaluated for correlated gene polymorphisms using the D coefficient. In order to identify the superior PRS, correlations between each of the two PRSs (additive and weighted) and phenotypic aspects (eLDLC level and DLCN score) were tested using Spearman\u2019s correlation.\n\nThe wPRS was also standardized by its mean and SD (wPRS Z score) and further used to test for associations with demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables. Also, the association of several variables (wPRS Z score included) with PCHD was tested in both univariate and multivariate models. The association of the wPRS with a clinical diagnosis of FH, based on DLCN score, was also tested. For these investigations, we used the following statistical tests: univariate and multivariate binomial logistic regression, simple linear regression, and ROC curves. The goodness-of-fit of the regression models was tested with the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test. Pairwise comparison of ROC curves for nested models was performed using the extra sum-of-squares F test.\n\nFactor analysis (PCA\u2014principal component analysis with Varimax rotation and Kaiser normalization) was conducted to reduce the initial 11 variables to a smaller number of factors that explain a significant proportion of the total variance (at least 60%). This analysis aimed to identify how these variables clustered together and to determine which variables most effectively explained the overall variance among PCHD patients.\n\nFor the prediction of PCHD, apart from multivariate regression models, we employed an artificial neural network approach using a multilayer perceptron model. The data were partitioned with 60% allocated to the training set and 40% to the testing set. The model settings included a standardized rescaling method for covariates and the number of possible units in the hidden layer ranging from 1 to 50. The network architecture was automatically selected by SPSS software version 20, resulting in the following parameters: six hidden layers (excluding the bias unit) with a Hyperbolic tangent activation function and two output layers with a Softmax activation function and a Cross-entropy error function. Due to the randomization of participants into the training and testing partitions, the neural network\u2019s structure and performance are unlikely to be identical upon consecutive tests. This variability is particularly relevant given the relatively small cohort size in this study, compared to the large datasets (\u201cbig data\u201d) typically used for such neural networks. Thus, to obtain a more reliable estimate of the neural network\u2019s accuracy in correctly classifying participants into the HC or PCHD groups, we conducted 100 iterations of the multilayer perceptron model and averaged the results, including the percentage of correct classifications, AUC values, and the normalized importance of variables.\n\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nWhile the diagnosis and management of monogenic FH have been well established, polygenic hypercholesterolemia has yet to be addressed by current guidelines, despite increasing evidence that small-effect LDLC-increasing variants can collectively result in an FH phenotype similar to that of the monogenic form. In a pioneering study on the Romanian population, we demonstrated that an 8-SNP LDLC polygenic score correlates with phenotypic aspects and that individuals with high scores may be at increased risk of premature coronary heart disease. Moreover, the polygenic score may serve as an effective screening tool for the early identification of individuals at risk of developing an FH phenotype. Our findings align in all major aspects with similar studies conducted in other populations across Europe and globally. In conclusion, we have outlined ten potential advantages of integrating LDLC polygenic scores into mainstream cardiology practice. However, the successful implementation of LDLC polygenic scores requires national and international collaboration, standardization, and validation in prospective studies, taking into account each population\u2019s genetic specificity\u2014an endeavor that remains elusive at the time of writing this paper."}

Introduction\n\nAutoimmune diseases characterized by aberrant immune responses against self-antigens pose significant challenges in clinical management due to their chronic nature and complex etiology [,,]. Among the critical regulatory components of the immune system is interleukin 10 (IL10), a cytokine known for its potent anti-inflammatory properties [,,]. Even though different subsets of T cells, monocytes, and macrophages are considered to be the main sources of IL10, regulatory B cells with high potency for IL10 production have also been found to play a pivotal role in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and protection against the detrimental effects of autoimmune responses through their anti-inflammatory actions [,,,,]. IL10 and IL10 receptor deficiencies lead to severe intestinal inflammation and early-onset inflammatory bowel disease in both mice and humans, highlighting the importance of IL10 signaling in maintaining intestinal mucosal homeostasis [,]. Resident microbiota activates IL10-producing regulatory B cells through TLR2, MyD88, and PI3K pathways, which help maintain colonic homeostasis and reduce T cell activation [], which is critical in the context of inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. In the pathogenesis of such severe autoimmune diseases as type 1 diabetes (T1D) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), IL10 plays a multifaceted role. Some studies showed that IL10 can be linked to a tolerant state of regulatory IL10-producing B cells in T1D patients; however, it can exhibit a pathogenic action at the onset of the disease []. During SLE, IL10-producing B cells contribute to autoantibody production and tissue damage, while other studies indicate that they play a regulatory role in suppressing disease and immune responses [,]. SLE B cells display defective TLR9 responses, leading to the diminished production of anti-inflammatory IL10, which may contribute to the breakdown of B cell tolerance and the persistence of autoreactive B cells in SLE []. Negative correlations have been observed between IL10-producing regulatory B cell numbers and disease activity in patients with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome []. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms governing IL10 expression is essential for elucidating the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases and identifying potential therapeutic targets. It has been shown that genetic variations (in most cases, single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNP) of non-coding regions play a functional role in gene expression and susceptibility to various diseases [,,]. There is a list of polymorphisms located in the regulatory elements of the IL10 gene that have been implicated in the regulation of its expression [,,]. The single nucleotide polymorphism rs3024505 is located in an intergenic region proximal to the 3\u2032-untranslated region of the IL10 gene []. The rs3024505(T) allele may be a risk factor in inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis) in the Han Chinese, Australian/New Zealand, and European populations [,,,,,]. Moreover, rs3024505(T) has been shown to be associated with SLE among Swedish and American populations [,] and with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome among Italian individuals [] (). On the other hand, the major rs3024505(C) variant is considered a risk factor for T1D among British populations and North Americans [,]. Investigating how genetic variations influence IL10 expression in B cells is vital for understanding their role in disease progression. Our study focuses on elucidating the functional effects of the rs3024505 SNP on IL10 expression in human B cells.\n\n\n2. Results\n\n\n2.1. The Risk T Allele of rs3024505 Abolishes IL10 Enhancer Activity in B Cell Line Reh\n\nThe polymorphism rs3024505(C/T), which is an eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) for the IL10 gene [], is located in the potential enhancer [] (chr1:206766108-206767105; GRCh38/hg38) downstream of this gene (). This genomic region has epigenetic marks of enhancer regulatory elements\u2014high levels of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac histone modifications, DNase I hypersensitivity sites, and clusters of transcription factor binding sites []. The minor rs3024505(T) allele frequency ranges from 0.026 to 0.164, depending on the population ().\n\nWe conducted the functional analysis of the regulatory elements of human IL10 locus using a double luciferase assay in immortalized pro-B cell line Reh (B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-ALL) [], and Namalwa and Raji B cells from Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, which represent germinal center B cells []. The IL10 promoter (), which was also chosen according to the epigenetic marks of promoter regions [], was cloned into the pGL3-basic vector, and the putative enhancer region of the IL10 gene was cloned after the luciferase gene polyadenylation signal. Additional variants of the reporter constructs contained the same enhancer region with the minor allele of the rs3024505(T) and a control genomic DNA fragment with no regulatory properties (). We then transfected the resulting constructs into B cells and stimulated the cells with a mix of CD40L, CpG, and IL21, which has been shown to be effective in terms of the induction of B lymphocytes with high immunosuppressive capacity, including IL10 secretion [].\n\nAs a result, the IL10 promoter appeared to be more active in the Reh cell line than in the Namalwa and Raji cells (). Similarly, the reporter vector with the putative enhancer containing the common rs3024505(C) allele demonstrated a 3.5-fold increase in luciferase expression compared to the vector containing an irrelevant sequence in only Reh cells. The conversion of the rs3024505(C) variant to the minor T allele abrogated IL10 enhancer activity.\n\n\n2.2. The Risk rs3024505(T) Allele Disrupts Functional STAT3 Binding Site\n\nChanges in the sequence of the transcription factor (TF) binding site within the region overlapping the SNP can alter the activity of regulatory elements []. According to the ADASTRA database [], the rs3024505(C) creates an allele-specific STAT3 binding site that is disrupted in the presence of the risk T allele. To assess this allele-specific binding, we performed a DNA pull-down assay using nuclear extracts from stimulated Reh cells that were incubated with DNA probes containing an enhancer sequence overlapping rs3024505, followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies against STAT3. The real-time qPCR quantification of the enriched amplicons revealed that anti-STAT3 antibodies effectively precipitated the amplicons with the common rs3024505(C) allele, which has been predicted to create a STAT3 binding site (, left). In contrast, DNA probes carrying the risk rs3024505(T) variant showed no significant precipitation. Similarly, both variants containing point mutations designed to disrupt STAT3 binding exhibited negligible precipitation (, right).\n\n\n2.3. The IL10 Enhancer Exhibits Functional Activity upon STAT3 Binding\n\nTo further validate the hypothesis that the regulatory effect of rs3024505 on IL10 expression is mediated by altered STAT3 binding, we performed the siRNA-mediated knockdown of STAT3 in stimulated Reh cells. STAT3 expression was suppressed by approximately 60% (A), resulting in the equalization of enhancer activity between variants carrying alternative rs3024505 alleles in stimulated Reh cells, as measured by reporter expression (B). Furthermore, the common rs3024505(C) allele did not affect enhancer activity when point mutations disrupted the STAT3 binding site (B). This pattern of reporter activity mirrored the in vitro binding affinity of STAT3 (), suggesting that the enhancer activity of the IL10 gene associated with the common rs3024505(C) allele in the B cell model can be attributed to the presence of a functional STAT3 binding site.\n\n\n3. Discussion\n\nThe role of non-coding polymorphisms in the regulation of gene expression and disease development is becoming increasingly recognized. This study investigated the impact of the polymorphism rs3024505, an eQTL for the IL10 gene implicated in autoimmune disorders. Prior research has demonstrated a genetic association between the minor rs3024505(T) allele and several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, Crohn\u2019s disease, and ulcerative colitis. Our reporter assay data revealed that rs3024505 resides within an enhancer of the IL10 gene. This enhancer exhibited activity in stimulated pro-B cell line Reh, with the rs3024505(T) variant exhibiting a significant reduction in enhancer/promoter activity. Given that genetic variants can impact regulatory element activity by modifying transcription factor binding, we conducted an in silico prediction analysis using the ADASTRA database to identify potential molecular factors. Our analysis identified STAT3 as a promising candidate, and subsequent validation in stimulated Reh cells confirmed its functional role in regulating IL10 expression. This is consistent with allele-specific binding of STAT3 to the rs3024505 region, as demonstrated by DNA affinity precipitation assays with nuclear extracts from polarized Th17 cells []. Additionally, a recent murine study reported the downregulation of IL10 transcription upon the deletion of STAT3 in CD19+ B cells [].\n\nTaken together, our results suggest that the IL10 enhancer activity associated with the common rs3024505(C) allele in B cells may be attributed to the presence of a functional STAT3 binding site. Intriguingly, we observed this effect only in the stimulated pro-B cell line Reh derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but not in Namalwa or Raji cells originating from Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma. We hypothesize that this difference may be attributed to the presence of the TEL-AML1 translocation in Reh cells, a characteristic feature of ALL that leads to the aberrant activation of STAT3 and subsequent IL10 expression [,]. Furthermore, this distinct IL10 regulation may be attributed to its pivotal role in pro-B cell survival and development []. Another potential explanation is the possible differentiation of activated pro-B cell Reh into monocyte-like cells [,]. These cells have the capacity to polarize into alternatively activated macrophages (M2), which actively secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines under the autocrine influence of IL10, probably in a STAT3-dependent manner [,]. We also suggest that the regulatory area surrounding rs3024505 could be involved in the transcriptional regulation of nearby genes belonging to the IL10 family of cytokines (IL19, IL20, IL24, etc.), given the existence of published works supporting this hypothesis [,,].\n\nThe suppressive capacity of IL10+ regulatory B cells has been reported to be diminished or absent in patients with various autoimmune diseases [,], suggesting that decreased IL10 expression may be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The heterogeneous population of regulatory B cells comprises a number of subsets of immature lymphocytes [,], including pro-B cells, which demonstrated statistically significant results in this study. Previous research has shown that pro-B cells may possess immunosuppressive properties and can protect against autoimmune reactions and graft-versus-host disease [,]. The association of rs3024505(T) with several autoimmune diseases likely arises as a consequence of its contribution to STAT3-mediated IL10 downregulation (). It is noteworthy that the major rs3024505(C) allele is, on the contrary, considered a risk factor for T1D, as indicated by the meta-analysis of polymorphism associations [,]. This phenomenon may be attributed to the pathogenic role of IL10 at the initial stages of the disease, with its local release potentially accelerating the development of T1D [].\n\nFurther functional analysis of rs3024505 in gene-edited cell models would be valuable for a more comprehensive understanding of the observed regulatory mechanism.\n\n\n4. Materials and Methods\n\n\n4.1. Cell Cultures\n\nReh, Namalwa, and Raji cells line were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium (PanEco, Moscow, Russia) supplemented with 10% FBS (Corning, New York, NY, USA), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (all PanEco, Moscow, Russia), non-essential amino acids, and 10 mM HEPES (all Gibco, Kwartsweg, The Netherlands). The day before electroporation with test plasmids, cells were treated with a mixture of recombinant CD40L (1 \u03bcg/mL, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), IL21 (25 ng/mL, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), and CpG (2 \u03bcM, ODN2006, 5\u2032-tcgtcgttttgtcgttttgtcgtt-3\u2032).\n\n\n4.2. Reporter Plasmids\n\nTo analyze the activity of IL10 regulatory elements, we amplified the putative IL10 promoter region (chr1:206772325-206775043; GRCh38/hg38), putative enhancer elements including rs3024505 (chr1:206766108-206767105; GRCh38/hg38), and a similarly sized irrelevant control sequence (a previously published intronic region of the STAT3 gene with no epigenetic features of the regulatory area; chr17:42356476-42357555; GRCh38/hg38 []) by PCR using human genomic DNA (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as a template and specific primers containing restriction sites (). The promoter was cloned into a pGL3-basic luciferase reporter construct (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using BglII and PagI/NcoI restriction sites, and the enhancer or control sequence was cloned using BamHI and SalI restriction sites downstream of the luciferase coding sequence and polyadenylation signal. To analyze the influence of rs3024505(C/T), site-specific nucleotide changes in enhancer regions were introduced by two-stage PCR using internal overlapping primers (). Plasmid DNA was extracted and purified with the NucleoBond Xtra Midi Kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) and verified by Sanger sequencing (EIMB RAS \u201cGenome\u201d center, Moscow, Russia).\n\n\n4.3. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay\n\nFor the luciferase assay, 2.5 mln cells were transfected with 5 \u03bcg of test plasmids combined with 0.5 \u03bcg of pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase control vector from the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Cells were electroporated using the Neon Transfection System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with appropriate parameters: three 10 ms 1400 V pulses for Reh cells, one 30 ms 1300 V pulse for Raji cells, and two 20 ms 1350 V pulses for Namalwa. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h post-transfection using a 20/20n Luminometer (TurnerBioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).\n\n\n4.4. siRNA-Mediated STAT3 Knockdown\n\nWe used previously published short interfering RNA (siRNA) against the STAT3 gene [], and appropriate sequences of the control scrambled RNA (siRNA-scr) were obtained by the Invivogen siRNA Wizard v3.1 tool (). Single-stranded RNAs were commercially synthesized and annealed as previously described []. For STAT3 genetic knockdown, 3 mln cells were transfected by electroporation (as described above) with a 500 pmol mix of STAT3-specific siRNAs or siRNA-scr duplexes. Cells were cultured for 48 h and then were transfected with 5 \u03bcg of test vectors, 0.5 \u03bcg of pRL-CMV control, and 300 pmol more of siRNA or siRNA-scr. The luciferase reporter assay was conducted after cell cultivation for 24 h.\n\n\n4.5. DNA Pull-Down Assay\n\nWe performed a pull-down assay based on the method described earlier []. The \u201cpull-down\u201d primers () were designed to produce 154 bp amplicons, corresponding to the sequences with minor and common rs3024505 variants; plasmids containing enhancer elements with different nucleotide variants were used as templates for the PCR reaction. Control amplicon was produced by PCR amplification with the \u201cpull-down-control\u201d primers pair (), including a 161 bp with no predicted STAT3 binding sites. All PCR products were verified by Sanger sequencing. Nuclear extracts were prepared from stimulated Reh cells using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmatic Extraction Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Amplicons were incubated with 1 \u03bcg STAT3 Mouse mAb IgG (GB12176-100, ServiceBio, Wuhan, China) or 1 \u03bcg Rabbit mAb IgG XP Isotype Control (DA1E, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) as an isotypic control. The immunoprecipitation of DNA\u2013protein complexes was performed using Protein A Mag Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles Buckinghamshire, UK). Eluted DNA was quantified by qPCR in real-time using \u201cpull-down\u201d primers.\n\n\n4.6. RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis and qPCR in Real-Time\n\nTotal RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described in the manufacturer\u2019s manual. The reverse transcription of total RNA was carried out using the MMLV RT Kit (Evrogen, Moscow, Russia) and Oligo(dT)15 as primers. Real-time PCR analysis was performed using the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and qPCRmix-HS SYBR (Evrogen, Moscow, Russia). \u03b2-Actin (ACTB) was used as a reference gene for STAT3 expression. The pull-down amplicon amount was normalized to the value obtained with the negative control DNA fragment. Sequences of oligonucleotide primers are presented in .\n\n\n4.7. Statistical Analysis\n\nWe performed statistical analysis using GraphPad Prism 9 software. Statistical significance was estimated using unpaired Student\u2019s t-test or two-way ANOVA. p-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Data for each sample represent the result of at least three independent experiments. Real-time qPCR and luciferase assays were additionally performed in two technical replicates. All data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM."}

Introduction\n\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma, which is optic nerve degeneration that slowly progresses over years and inevitably leads to blindness [,]. According to an editorial [], an operational definition of glaucoma as a set of symptoms that can be attributed to this condition is still a source of dispute across international healthcare organizations due to non-uniform levels of healthcare for different communities worldwide. However, if access to healthcare were easier [,], optic nerve damage could be detected directly [] rather than by reliance on high intraocular pressure (IOP), which is today\u2019s practice [,]. The risk factors for POAG often named in the literature are hypertension [], age-related diseases [], genetic susceptibility, developmental disorders [], tobacco smoking [], alcohol consumption [], fast-food diets [], obesity [], heavy weight lifting, and high-intensity physical exercise; meanwhile, the Mediterranean diet [] and moderate-intensity aerobic exercise are mentioned as being protective against the development of this condition []. In addition, according to the WHO [], the prevalence of anxiety (9.8%) and depression (5.8%) in POAG correlates with its severity. Consequently, past illnesses and bad habits may aggravate POAG, while a healthy lifestyle may alleviate it.\n\nMoreover, POAG appears to be a genetically complex and intricate disease with risk factors that may contribute to its progression depending on both genetic and epigenetic backgrounds along with environmental factors rather than independently []. Nevertheless, high IOP is the only known modifiable risk factor for POAG [] and the cornerstone of anti-POAG therapy []. Finally, the universal demand for research into POAG is so great that out of 9244 original POAG-related articles cited in the freely accessible PubMed database [], 464 have been added in the year 2024 as on 31 October 2024.\n\nIn the post-genome era of life sciences, genome-wide experimental data on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [] and the results of their scrutiny using Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) [] and Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis [] have gained special importance. With the advent of new diagnostic tools, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and standard automated perimetry (SAP)\u2014which are supposed to directly determine the amount of damage to the optic nerve [,,]\u2014in addition to the traditional method based on measuring IOP [,,], the search for genetic and molecular-biological markers of POAG that can enhance the diagnostic abilities of high IOP as a traditional clinical marker of this disease has become a trend [].\n\nGWAS and QTL results allowed POAG-associated loci and the POAG-related genes within these loci to be identified on human chromosomes. The number of POAG-related genes varies from one source of information to the next, reported as 7 [], 11 [,], 18 [], 26 [], 27 [], and 39 in the OMIM database []; 153 in the Indian Genetic Disease Database (IGDD) [,]; and 153 in the NCBI Gene Database [] (accessed on 10 July 2024). Bioinformatics-driven meta-analyses [] allowed the list of the POAG-related genes to be expanded to 522 by adding human genes associated with ocular hypertension (OHT), juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG), primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), and normal tension glaucoma (NTG) as pathologies diagnostically similar to POAG.\n\nThe ClinVar database entries related to the biomedical SNP markers of predisposition to human diseases [] included 1155 biomedical SNP markers of predisposition to POAG as on 10 July 2024. (Hereinafter, \u201cbiomedical\u201d should be understood as \u201cclinical\u201d for POAG patients and as \u201cexperimental\u201d for laboratory POAG models using human or animal cells, tissues, and/or organs.) Most of these SNP markers modify the protein-coding regions and, consequently, protein structures and functions in an irreversible way. Regulatory region variants (regulatory SNPs) that only change the concentrations of the affected genes\u2019 products occur much less frequently, and their effects can be compensated for by changing lifestyle or through the use of medication []. One of the regulatory SNP markers of predisposition to POAG is rs1143627:T in the promoter of the IL1B gene for human interleukin 1\u03b2, as a comparison of POAG patients and healthy individuals in Brazil suggests []. This SNP changes the affinity of this promoter to the TATA-binding protein (TBP) during the formation of the preinitiation complex [], which is absolutely required for transcription initiation in knockout TBP-/- animals [] and for a non-specific increase in gene expression levels proportional to the increase in TBP affinity for their promoters []. Consequently, an in silico prediction of candidate SNP markers that are capable of significantly changing TBP affinity for the promoters of the POAG-related genes can help identify the universal molecular mechanisms underlying processes involved in POAG pathogenesis.\n\nWe have previously developed and published SNP_TATA_Comparator, a freely available web service [] for assessing in silico the level of significance p of the difference between TBP affinity for the ancestral and the minor variant of a given SNP in a human gene promoter. The use of this web service enabled us to predict candidate SNP markers for a broad range of disorders like age-related diseases [], hypertension [], and atherosclerosis [], to name a few. SNP_TATA_Comparator was independently used by other researchers in a clinical search for SNP markers of predisposition to age-specific pulmonary tuberculosis []. The use of SNP_TATA_Comparator on the entire human genome resulted in Human_SNP_TATAdb [], a knowledge base on all human genome-wide SNP markers that can either upregulate or downregulate protein-coding genes by changing TBP affinity for the promoters regulating these genes. We have also developed OrthoWeb [,], a freely available software package for estimating the phylostratigraphic age indices in automated mode, and ANDSystem [], a toolbox for data mining analysis of the literature sources and databases. Here, we applied these two developments to perform a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between evolutionary origins, molecular mechanisms of function, and the whole-genome pattern for all 153 POAG-related genes in the NCBI Gene Database [] as on 10 July 2024. The results obtained were verified against five independent web services\u2014PANTHER [], DAVID [], STRING [], MetaScape [], and GeneMANIA []\u2014as well as the ClinVar database [].\n\n\n2. Results\n\nWe explored all genes (n = 153) that, according to the NCBI Gene Database [] as on 10 July 2024, are associated with POAG (see the top row of ). The GeneCards-related symbols [] for each of these genes are listed in the \u201cHuman Gene\u201d column of  (hereinafter, any digit prefixed with \u201dS\u201d signifies that the corresponding figure or table is posted in  [,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,]).\n\n\n2.1. Assessment of the Phylostratigraphic Age Index (PAI) of the POAG-Related Genes\n\nIn step 1, we performed a phylostratigraphic analysis of all 153 POAG-related genes (, the down arrow labeled \u201cStep 1: in silico phylostratigraphic analysis\u201d) by applying our publicly available software package OrthoWeb [,] (accessed on 10 July 2024) previously developed as a plug-in [,] to the web-based software environment Cytoscape [] (for details, see ).\n\nIn brief, the NCBI Gene identifier (ID) of a given human gene was used as input data for OrthoWeb [,], which automatically searched for all freely available DNA sequences of the corresponding orthologous animal genes according to the KEGG Orthology (KO) Database []. We then identified the taxonomic rank of the most recent common ancestor of these animal species as the \u201cphylogenetic age index (PAI)\u201d. The numerical value of this index is taken as its projection onto the taxonomic scale of molecular evolution according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) []. Such numerical values were produced by OrthoWeb as outputs [,] for each human gene examined (the rightmost column \u201cthe most recent common ancestor\u201d of ).\n\nWe then performed a statistical analysis on the PAI scores obtained for all 153 POAG-related genes (for the results, see the histogram and the box-and-whisker plot in the upper half of ). As can be seen in the left-hand plot, the PAI score distribution of the 123 POAG-related genes (80%, blue) that appeared before the phylum Chordata (PAI = 4) is significantly closer to the uniform distribution (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test: K = 1.16 at p < 0.05) rather than to the normal distribution (K = 3.66 at p > 0.70). By contrast, the PAI score distribution of the remaining 30 POAG-related genes (20%, green) appears to be normal (K = 1.37 at p < 0.05) rather than uniform (K = 2.34 at p > 0.10). The uniform and normal distributions often approximate the frequencies of a biological object corresponding to the opposite extremes\u2014(i) independent of one another [], and (ii) interdependent on one another as integral parts of a whole\u2014in line with the Central Limit Theorem []. Hence, the following question arises: do the differences between the 123 POAG-related genes that emerged before Chordata (PAI < 4) and the 30 POAG-related genes that emerged after (PAI \u2265 4) Chordata have any biological sense? We will, for brevity\u2019s sake, call the former genes \u201colder\u201d rather than \u201cmore ancient\u201d and the latter genes \u201cyounger\u201d rather than \u201cmore recent\u201d throughout.\n\nThe box-and-whisker plots in the upper right of  show the differences in PAI scores between the POAG-related genes\u2014123 older (blue) and 30 younger (green)\u2014that were statistically significant according to the nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney U test (U = 18 at p < 0.05) and the parametric test Fisher\u2019s Z (Z = 2.22 at p < 0.05) run independently of each other.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the significant difference between the 123 older POAG-related genes, which appeared before Chordata, and the remaining 30 younger POAG-related genes, which appeared before or after Chordata, seems to be fairly robust to various independent statistical criteria.\n\n\n2.2. Data Mining Analysis of the POAG-Related Genes with ANDSystem\n\nAfter completion of step 1, we performed data mining from the publicly available literature sources and databases to verify the differences found between the 123 older and the 30 younger POAG-related genes. With the use of ANDSystem [] (accessed on 10 July 2024), we reconstructed two associative networks (see ) based on the two POAG-related gene sets (see ).\n\ngraphically depict the data-mining results showing which molecular pathways can integrate the genes that appeared before or after Chordata.  shows how the 123 older POAG-related genes contribute to the biological processes \u201cpathogenesis\u201d and \u201capoptotic process\u201d as the two most significantly well-supported molecular pathways identified by the use of ANDSystem [] (statistical significance levels after Bonferroni\u2019s correction for multiple comparisons were PADJ = 10\u2212114 and PADJ = 10\u2212102, respectively). Briefly, once fed with the input gene sets, ANDSystem [] automatically extracted data from PubMed articles [] and many other publicly available databases. In this figure, the rightmost column contains 17 of the 123 older POAG-related genes; these 17 genes were not involved in either pathogenesis or apoptotic processes because we heuristically limited our analysis to as few as the two most significant pathways, allowing for the possibility that these genes may function in other pathways.\n\nAdditionally, 9 and 15 older POAG-related genes were found to correspond to pathogenesis and apoptotic processes, respectively. The remaining 82 older POAG-related genes appear between the circular arrow icons textually labeled with either \u201cpathogenesis\u201d or \u201capoptotic process\u201d, which symbolizes their involvement in both molecular pathways at once.\n\nAs can be seen from  (the notation being the same as above), five of the thirty younger POAG-related genes are involved in inflammatory responses; three, in immune responses; three, in neither; and each of the remaining nineteen participates in both pathways at a time.\n\nAltogether,  illustrate that the 123 older POAG-related genes are likely to differ from the 30 younger in at least four molecular pathways in which they function. However, this conclusion is only valid if these results are robust to variations across different independent data mining tools. For this reason, we fed the two human gene sets\u2014the 123 older and the 30 younger POAG-related genes\u2014to the independent web services PANTHER [], DAVID [], STRING [], MetaScape [], and GeneMANIA [], which implement data mining. The results obtained are shown in .\n\n\n2.3. Verification of ANDSystem Outputs for POAG-Related Genes Against Results Obtained with Independent Data Mining Tools\n\nAs can be seen from  [], the results obtained using the five independent data mining tools and expressed in identifiers of either Gene Ontology terms [] or KEGG pathways [] were in part consistent with each other and in part not. Taking this into account, we heuristically searched the PubMed database [] for original scientific articles in which competing Gene Ontology terms or KEGG pathways co-occurred in the same molecular genetic context (see ).\n\nFor example, row #1 of  shows \u201cpathogenesis\u201d as ANDSystem outputs [] () and \u201cresponse to hypoxia\u201d as DAVID outputs [] ( [,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,]), even though the input data were identical, namely, the 123 older POAG-related genes. The rightmost column cites a biomedical review indicating that hypoxia-induced ocular injuries contribute to POAG pathogenesis, supporting the consistency of the data mining results. A row-by-row examination of  led us to the conclusion that there is no contradiction between the data mining results obtained with ANDSystem [], on the one hand, and PANTHER [], DAVID [], STRING [], MetaScape [], and GeneMANIA [], on the other hand. This may indicate that the 123 older and the 30 younger POAG-related genes function in different molecular pathways.\n\n\n2.4. Supervised Annotation of the Effects of Changes in the POAG-Related Genes\u2019 Expression Levels on POAG Alleviation and Aggravation\n\nIn step 2, we compiled biomedical data from PubMed [] (accessed on 10 July 2024) on the effect of underexpression and overexpression of the 153 POAG-related genes that can alleviate or aggravate POAG (for details, see ). A summary of POAG-related biomedical reports and reviews is provided in .\n\n\n2.5. In Silico Estimation of the Effects of SNPs in the POAG-Related Genes\u2019 Promoters on TBP Affinity for These Genes\u2019 Promoters\n\nWith Human_SNP_TATAdb [], we selected, within the promoters of all 153 POAG-related genes, the SNPs that\u2014according to our previous in silico estimates\u2014statistically significantly change the expression levels of these genes, as briefly described in  and in more detail in , the  named \u201csupplementary methods for DNA sequence analysis\u201d.\n\nlists all 3835 SNPs selected for analysis, each annotated with POAG-related biomedical data on how downregulation and upregulation of the 123 POAG-related genes can aggravate or alleviate POAG ().\n\n\n2.6. Selective In Vitro Verification of In Silico Estimates of the Effects of SNPs in Human Gene Promoters on TBP Affinity for These Promoters\n\nBefore proceeding to statistical analysis of the effects that the POAG-induced changes in the expression levels of POAG-related genes should have on POAG progression according to our in silico estimation, we randomly verified these estimates using the corresponding experimental values. We had obtained and published these estimates previously (see ). Row #1 of  presents a biomedical SNP marker of predisposition to POAG, rs1143627:T, which, according to a cohort-based study in Brazil [], occurs in the human gene IL1B. As can be seen, this SNP marker corresponds to a C\u2192T substitution, which leads to the formation of the canonical form of the TBP binding site, the TATA box (appears in uppercase further): \u201cttttgaaagcCataaaaacag\u201d \u2192 \u201cttttgaaagcTATAAAAacag\u201d. Based on our in silico estimates, this event accounts for about a 2.5-fold reduction in the equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, of the TBP\u2013promoter complex, from 4.50 \u00b1 0.39 to 1.76 \u00b1 0.17 nanomoles per liter (nM) (). The ratio of these estimates, KD(min)/KD(WT) = 1.76/4.50 = 0.39, corresponds to 0.24, the value that we measured experimentally in one of our previous efforts [].\n\nis a graphical representation of , where the \u201c\u2192\u201d arrow points to rs1143627:T, the biomedical SNP marker of predisposition to POAG in Brazil []. This figure shows a total of 11 pairs of similar in silico estimates (the x-axis) against experimental in vitro data (the y-axis), which, according to five statistical criteria, significantly correlate with each other. The area between the two dotted curves corresponds to the 95% confidence interval, into which rs1143627:T falls []. This observation further supports the relevance of our previously made in silico estimates of the effects of SNPs on TBP affinity for human gene promoters, and reinforces the need for further in silico exploration of the effects of these SNPs on the promoters of POAG-related genes relating to predisposition to POAG. These estimates were published in the form of the Human_SNP_TATAdb knowledge base [].\n\n\n2.7. Frequencies of the SNPs That Significantly Change TBP Affinity for the Promoters of the POAG-Related Genes and for the Promoters of All Human Genes\n\nWe compared the occurrence of the 3835 SNPs that downregulate or upregulate the 153 POAG-related genes under study with the occurrence of the corresponding regulatory SNPs across the human genome, according to the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium [,,] (see the table in the center of ). Row #1 of this table shows that, according to the 1000 Genomes Consortium [,,], each individual human genome differs from the reference human genome by having an average of some 1000 regulatory SNPs, of which about 800 and 200 are, respectively, associated with underexpression and overexpression of the human genes whose promoters carry these SNPs.\n\nWithin the framework of Haldane\u2019s dilemma [] and Kimura\u2019s theory of neutral evolution [], this four-fold prevalence of the deleterious over beneficial regulatory SNPs corresponds to neutral drift in humans as a biological species on a genome-wide scale. As can be seen from the next two rows of the table, the occurrence of the SNPs that change the expression levels of the 123 older POAG-related genes and the 30 younger POAG-related genes significantly differs from the genome-wide pattern of the occurrence of regulatory SNPs under neutral drift (: PADJ < 10\u22123, binomial distribution with Bonferroni\u2019s correction).\n\nThus, we can conclude that all 153 POAG-related genes considered are under natural selection against their downregulation.\n\n\n2.8. Assessing the Effects of SNP-Induced Increases and Decreases in the Expression Levels of the Older and Younger POAG-Related Genes on POAG Alleviation and Aggravation\n\nIn step 3, in order to understand where selection that is acting on the 153 POAG-related genes (the table in ) is directed, we statistically analyzed the annotations in this work on how often the candidate SNP markers that change the expression levels of these genes can alleviate or aggravate POAG (). The lower part of  depicts the results obtained independently for the 123 older POAG-related genes (the left-hand (blue) box-and-whisker plot) and for the 30 younger POAG-related genes (the right-hand (green) box-and-whisker plot). As can be seen, the candidate SNP markers that significantly change the expression levels of the 123 older POAG-related genes mostly alleviate POAG, while those that have implications for the 30 younger POAG-related genes mostly aggravate it, according to the Mann\u2013Whitney U test and Fisher\u2019s Z.\n\n\n2.9. Verification Results for the Proposed Candidate SNP Markers of POAG Using ClinVar Entries Related to Biomedical SNP Markers of Diseases\n\nWith the use of the publicly available database ClinVar [] (accessed on 10 July 2024) containing biomedically proven SNP markers for human diseases, we checked each of the 3835 candidate SNP markers in the 153 POAG-related genes; these SNPs were taken from Human_SNP_TATAdb [] () as described in .  contains each of these 82 biomedical SNP markers associated with human diseases, these markers being known to change the expression levels of the 153 POAG-related genes, while  provides only a brief summary.\n\nFor example, row #1 of  contains two biomedical SNP markers for Tangier disease, rs886063317:C and rs886063317:G, which occur within the promoters of the human gene ABCA1.  details these as two nucleotide substitutions uppercased within their 10-base-pair flanks, namely: \u201cagccgaatctAgcgctcggtg\u201d \u2192 \u201cagccgaatctCgcgctcggtg\u201d and \u201cagccgaatctAgcgctcggtg\u201d \u2192 \u201cagccgaatctGgcgctcggtg\u201d. These substitutions may significantly downregulate this gene, thus potentially aggravating POAG through this molecular mechanism. Row #1 in the rightmost column of  references a comprehensive review [] on the comorbidity of POAG and Tangier disease, highlighting the two biomedical SNP markers as an agreement between the examined entries of the ClinVar database [] and Human_SNP_TATAdb knowledge base []. The bottom row of  summarizes that 17 out of the 18 human genes examined show similar agreements between these sources of information, with only one mismatch (the human gene CP). This level of agreement between the actual and predicted estimates of the effects of the SNP markers on POAG suggests statistical significance (PADJ < 0.05, binomial distribution criterion with Bonferroni\u2019s correction).\n\n\n2.10. RNA-Seq Data on Domestic and Wild Animals for Verification of the Proposed Candidate SNP Markers That Change the Expression Levels of the POAG-Related Genes\n\nAs can be seen in , the 153 POAG-related genes are under natural selection (the table in step 2) on the one hand; on the other hand, this natural selection has two opposite directions (the box-and-whisker plots in step 3): one toward POAG alleviation and one toward POAG aggravation. This phenomenon is known as destabilizing (disruptive) natural selection, which characterizes, in particular, animal domestication [].\n\nThis gave us another opportunity to independently verify the proposed candidate SNP markers that change the expression levels of the POAG-related genes against the transcriptome profiles of domestic and wild animals. To this end, we collected all relevant RNA-Seq data that we could find using the PubMed databases [] as on 10 July 2024 (for details, see ).\n\npresents 19 datasets taken from 12 original papers [,,,,,,,,], where a total of 2912 DEGs were identified in nine tissues of seven pairs of domestic and wild animals. With the use of the \u201cParalogs\u201d section of the freely available GeneCards database [], we found, for each of the 153 POAG-related genes, its homologous animal DEGs ( and ).\n\nFor example, the bottom row (#78) of  describes the human gene VDR, which encodes the vitamin D receptor. According to the left half of this row, VDR deficiency contributes to hypertension, which aggravates POAG [], while elevated VDR protects against retinal ganglion cell loss, which alleviates POAG []. As is evident from the right-hand half of this row, the guinea pig has VDR deficiency in the frontal cortex, which its wild counterpart cavy does not []. We compared the VDR levels in both Cavia species against those in their nearest common ancestor, which is traditionally approximated by the mean value of the trait in question [,,]. The comparison revealed that Vdr is deficient in the guinea pig and aggravates POAG and elevated in the cavy and alleviates POAG.  similarly describes expression changes in domestic and wild animals relative to those in their nearest common ancestors for 119 and 27 animal genes, which are homologous to the 123 older and the 30 younger POAG-related human genes, respectively (). As the entries in the bottom row of  suggest, the 123 older POAG-related genes are statistically significantly different from the 30 younger POAG-related genes in terms of the phenotypic manifestations of their animal homologs: POAG is alleviated in the wild animals and aggravated in the domestic animals (p < 0.05, binomial distribution test). That is why POAG aggravation during animal domestication provides evidence in favor of destabilizing natural selection, to which the POAG-related genes are subject (see ), within the current concept of the human self-domestication syndrome [].\n\n\n3. Discussion\n\n\n3.1. Why the 153 POAG-Related Genes?\n\nThe most disputable point of this work is perhaps why we chose these 153 POAG-related genes. On the one hand, this choice led to the biological results being reported herein, while, on the other hand, the functional importance of many human gene loci that have been associated with POAG by GWAS and QTL remains unclear or unsupported by independent studies. Moreover, analysis of freely available sources revealed some reporting from 7 to 153 POAG-related genes [,,,,,,,], depending on the age and objectives of the research paper. Curiously, we found a source reporting as many as 522 for a meta-analysis of POAG and diagnostically similar diseases, namely, OHT, JOAG, PCG, and NTG [].\n\nA single NCBI Gene [] query made on 10 July 2024 (for technical details, see ) returned a 153-strong set of POAG-related genes, as did an independent source [,]. That encouraged us to proceed with these 153 POAG-related genes to ensure that an independent researcher will make the same choice.\n\n\n3.2. POAG-Related Genes That Appeared Before and After Chordata Became Different as Lampreys Evolved the Camera-Type Eye\n\nIn this study, we for the first time found that the POAG-related genes that had appeared before and after Chordata differ from each other (see  and ). This is consistent with the current understanding of the molecular evolution of the eye []. Indeed, lancelets of the genus Branchiostoma, some of the older chordates have only Hesse\u2019s eyecups [,], while the somewhat more evolutionarily advanced lampreys of the family Petromyzontidae have eyespot-like immature eyes beneath a non-transparent skin in their larva but their adults possess a camera-type eye [], as do all the others in the human lineage on the Tree of Life []. As the only known modifiable risk factor for POAG [] is high intraocular pressure (IOP), which is impossible without the camera-type eye, then the phylostratigraphic dilemma of having appeared before and after Chordata, in the context of POAG, comes down to the ophthalmological dilemma of having appeared before and after the camera-type eye. Thus, our finding that the POAG-related genes that appeared before and after Chordata aligns with current knowledge of both molecular evolution and POAG.\n\n\n3.3. The 123 Older POAG-Related Genes Responsible for Pathogenesis and Apoptosis Play a Critical Role in How Misfolded Protein Aggregates Can Aggravate POAG\n\nThe blue-colored histogram in  depicts the uniform distribution of the 123 older genes of all 153 POAG-related genes across three taxa\u2014Cellular organism, Eukaryota, and Metazoa\u2014on the evolutionary scale of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, KEGG []. Additionally,  depicts the associative network of how these genes may contribute to pathogenesis and the apoptotic process based on our data mining through publicly available reports and databases. Indeed, in a cellular model of POAG [], intracellular aggregates of misfolded proteins in the trabecular meshwork can induce apoptosis as a kind of pathogenesis, playing a key role in how misfolded protein aggregates can aggravate POAG. We can therefore state that our findings on the 123 older POAG-related genes that appeared before Chordata are consistent with what is known about the role of apoptosis in POAG pathogenesis.\n\nPut together, these facts suggest that the uniform distribution of the 123 older POAG-related genes with respect to PAI (the blue-colored histogram in the upper left of ) may be interpreted biologically: the genes that produce misfolded proteins aggregating in intracellular complexes and thus aggravating POAG may have appeared independently in the course of evolution.\n\n\n3.4. Normal Distribution of PAI Values of the 30 Younger POAG-Related Genes Involved in the Immune Response Has a Peak at Vertebrata, When Adaptive Immunity Appeared\n\nThe green-colored histogram in the upper left of  corresponds to the normal distribution, peaking between the subphylum Vertebrata (PAI = 6525 Mya []) and the clade Euteleostomi (PAI = 7420 Mya []), according to the evolutionary scale of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, KEGG [].  shows the association gene network of these genes, where they are mainly involved in the immune response, according to our data mining through freely available publications and databases. This aligns with an original study [] and a comprehensive review [], both reporting on how the Transib transposon in jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomata, approximately 500 Mya) gave rise to the part of adaptive immunity that is able to recognize antigens due to V(D)J recombination in immunoglobulin genes during antibody maturation. Therefore, our results on the 30 younger POAG-related genes, which appeared after Chordata, are consistent with how immunity and POAG are viewed by the scientific community.\n\nIn summary, we propose a feasible biological interpretation of the normal distribution of the 30 younger POAG-related genes with respect to PAI (the green-colored histogram in the upper left of ): it is possible that shortly after Chordata evolved the camera-type eye, the natural selection of new POAG-related genes started to act so as to provide adaptive support to this eye\u2019s architecture by producing the immune and inflammatory responses to POAG aggravating factors.\n\n\n3.5. Differences Between Domestic and Wild Animals in How POAG-Related Genes Alleviate or Aggravate POAG Fit in with Current Views of Natural Selection in Domestic and Wild Animals\n\nThe bottom row of  shows that the pressure natural selection exerts on wild animals may alleviate POAG, while artificial selection during animal domestication may aggravate POAG, as our in silico calculations suggest. This conclusion is consistent with one made by Zhang and colleagues [], stating that natural selection eliminates sick animal individuals in the wild, while artificial animal selection during domestication does not as it serves human needs; for example, the pig is farmed primarily for pork, no matter what the POAG status.\n\n\n3.6. POAG as a Symptom of the Human Self-Domestication Syndrome Is Consistent with POAG Aggravation by Anthropogenic Factors\n\nThe above-discussed considerations suggest that POAG may be a symptom of the human self-domestication syndrome []. With PubMed [], we found a medical opinion that industrialization increases POAG prevalence by facilitating the transmission of Helicobacter pylori infection []. In addition, a recent cohort-based study in Shanghai [] revealed environmental pollution with fine particulate matter as a risk factor for POAG through elevation of intraocular pressure. Finally, according to a comprehensive biomedical review [], circadian rhythm disruption aggravates POAG.\n\nBy summarizing the examples of how anthropogenic factors that never occur in the wild but can aggravate POAG nonetheless, we can conclude that this may be a symptom of the human self-domestication syndrome [], a downside of being civilized.\n\n\n3.7. Study Limitations\n\nAdmittedly, the setup of our in silico studies places limitations on the use of the 3835 candidate SNP markers that significantly alter TBP affinity for the promoters of the 153 POAG-related genes and, through this molecular mechanism, the expression levels of these genes. Because the consideration of these candidate SNP markers, for example in adjuvant therapy of POAG, may lead to health deterioration, any such uses should be preceded by cohort-based studies of these SNPs.\n\nThe results presented herein were obtained by considering TBP interactions with human gene promoters during the initiation of these genes\u2019 transcription\u2014specifically, at the point that these promoters that are densely packed into a transcriptionally inactive nucleosome re-assemble into the preinitiation complex as a stand-alone modulator of these genes\u2019 expression levels, as independent experiments suggest (see for example []). Because the molecular mechanism operates in a step-by-step manner and so caters for the tissue-, stage-, and other types of specificity of human gene expression, our results reflect only the most general, non-specific patterns of aggravating or alleviating effects that the proposed candidate SNP markers have on POAG.\n\nFinally, our in silico estimates of the phenotypic manifestation of the proposed candidate SNP markers of POAG are not absolute facts but are statistically significant: they are relevant only on a whole-genome scale for Homo sapiens as a biological species in the human lineage on the Tree of Life.\n\n\n4. Materials and Methods\n\n\n4.1. The Human Genes\n\nFor the purposes of our work, we entered the search query [\u201cprimary open-angle glaucoma\u201d AND \u201cHomo sapiens\u201d] in the NCBI Gene online database search toolbox [], with the filters \u201cGenomic\u201d, \u201cEnsembl\u201d, \u201cProtein-coding genes\u201d, \u201cAnnotated genes\u201d, and \u201cCurrent\u201d set (accessed on 10 July 2024). The search returned 153 human genes (see the leftmost column \u201cHuman Gene\u201d of ).\n\n\n4.2. In Silico Rating of the KEGG-Based Phylostratigraphic Age Index (PAI) of a Human Gene\n\nWe calculated the KEGG-based [,] PAI of a given human gene using its NCBI Entrez gene number as input data for OrthoWeb [,] (accessed on 10 July 2024), a plugin [,] within Cytoscape []. This yielded the most recent common ancestor of all animal species, whose DNA sequence of this gene is already sequenced and documented in the KEGG Orthology (KO) database []. Thus, the evolutionary rank scale used according to KEGG [] was as follows: 1. Cellular organism as the conventional root of the phylogenetic tree of life, 4100 Mya []; 2. Eukaryota, 1850 Mya []; 3. Metazoa, 665 Mya []; 4. Chordata, 541 Mya []; 5. Craniata, 535 Mya []; 6. Vertebrata, 525 Mya []; 7. Euteleostomi, 420 Mya []; 8. Mammalia, 225 Mya []; 9. Eutheria, 160 Mya []; 10. Euarchontoglires, 65 Mya []; 11. Primates, 55 Mya []; 12. Haplorrhini, 50 Mya []; 13. Catarrhini, 44 Mya []; 14. Hominidae, 17 Mya []; 15. Homo, 2.8 Mya []; 16. Homo sapiens, 0.35 Mya [].\n\n\n4.3. Data Mining Analysis of Freely Available Publications and Databases Related to POAG\n\nWe performed data mining using ANDSystem [] accessed on 10 July 2024, run in automated mode with \u201cHuman, [Human gene list], [Two most reasonable Pathways]\u201d as input data, with all other parameters set to default. ANDSystem outputs for two variants of the [Human gene list]\u2014(i) 123 older POAG-related genes and (ii) 30 younger POAG-related genes\u2014are graphically represented as two associative gene networks ( and , respectively).\n\nAfter that, we used the same 123 older and 30 younger POAG-related genes as inputs for PANTHER [], DAVID [], STRING [], MetaScape [], and GeneMANIA []. The outputs are given in .\n\nFinally, we heuristically identified PubMed [] articles that confirmed either agreement or disagreement between the ANDSystem outputs [] and the results obtained by the above-listed data mining toolboxes (see ).\n\n\n4.4. Biomedical Data on the Effect of Underexpression and Overexpression of the POAG-Related Genes on POAG Alleviation and Aggravation\n\nThe biomedical data used in this work on how underexpression and overexpression of the POAG-related genes aggravates or alleviates POAG were obtained from Lu\u2019s (2011) original article found in PubMed (accessed on 10 July 2024) using its web query service (see ).\n\n\n4.5. In Silico Estimation of How SNPs in the POAG-Related Genes\u2019 Promoters Change These Genes\u2019 Expression Levels\n\nThe in silico estimates for the levels of statistical significance of the effect of SNPs in the 90-base-pair proximal regions of the promoters of the 153 POAG-related genes on their underexpression and overexpression were taken from Human_SNP_TATAdb [].\n\nBriefly, we have previously analyzed [] all 5,305,816 SNPs in the proximal 90-base-pair regions before the TSSs of all 63,141 protein-coding transcriptomes from all 19,314 genes annotated in the human whole reference genome from the assembly GRCh38/hg38 according to Ensembl [] and dbSNP [] accessed on 1 August 2023 (for the details of the algorithm used, see : Section S1). At each elementary step, SNP_TATA_Comparator [] run in the automated mode helped assess the level of significance of the difference between the in silico estimates of TBP affinity for a given minor and the corresponding ancestral variant of an SNP in a human gene promoter according to the formulas in . Each minor allele was assessed separately and if the estimate suggested a significant increase or decrease in TBP-promoter affinity and eventually in the expression levels of the corresponding human gene [] against the ancestral allele being the norm, that minor allele along with the related calculations and results was recorded in Human_SNP_TATAdb []. In total, this knowledge base describes 445,875 SNPs, of which each can, according to our in silico estimates, significantly change the expression level of 1 of the 63,141 protein-coding human genes as compared to the reference variant of that gene taken for the norm.\n\nlists all the 3835 candidate SNP markers of changes in the expression levels of all the 153 POAG-related genes that were selected from among all 445,875 such SNPs identified for all the 63,141 protein-coding human genes and freely available in our the Human_SNP_TATAdb knowledge base [], https://www.sysbio.ru/Human_SNP_TATAdb/ (accessed on 10 July 2024).\n\n\n4.6. Selective Verification of the In Silico Estimates of the Effect of SNPs in Human Gene Promoters on TBP Affinity for These Promoters Against the Norm\n\nSelective verification of the in silico estimates of the effect of SNPs in human gene promoters on TBP affinity for these promoters against the norm was performed using our previously published affinities changed experimentally with the following 11 SNPs: rs1402972626, rs20067072, rs1393008234, rs1452787381, rs1452787381, rs183433761, rs367781716, rs750827465, rs72661131, rs563763767, and rs1143627. The last in the row is a biomedical SNP marker of predisposition to POAG in Brazil, as a cohort-based study suggests [] (see  for numerical representation and  for a graphical representation).\n\n\n4.7. Verification Methods for the Proposed Candidate SNP Markers of POAG Using ClinVar Entries Related to Biomedical SNP Markers of Diseases\n\nAmong the 3835 candidate SNP markers associated with significant changes in the expression levels of the 153 POAG-related genes, 82 were biomedically proven SNP markers linked to specific human diseases, according to the ClinVar database []. The information on these 82 SNPs is given in full in  and in brief in .\n\n\n4.8. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) in Domesticated Animals and Their Nearest Wild Counterparts\n\nWith the use of the web query search service of the PubMed database [] accessed on 10 July 2024, we compiled all independent experimental transcriptome profiling datasets of tissues from domestic and wild animals [,,,,,,,,,,,] (see ). Next, with the use of the \u201cParalogs\u201d section of the GeneCards database [], for each of the 153 POAG-related genes, we identified the paralogous animal genes that the domestic and wild animals express differentially; see  for detailed information and  for a summary.\n\n\n4.9. Statistical Analysis\n\nWe performed the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, Mann\u2013Whitney U test, Fisher\u2019s Z, Pearson\u2019s linear correlation test, Spearman\u2019s rank correlation test, Kendall\u2019s rank correlation test, the Goodman\u2013Kruskal generalized correlation test, Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test, and the binomial distribution test using appropriate options in STATISTICA (StatSoftTM, Tulsa, OK, USA).\n\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIn this work, we have for the first time estimated the phylostratigraphic age indices (PAIs) of all 153 POAG-related genes in the NCBI Gene Database [] accessed on 10 July 2024 (). This allowed us to separate them into two sets, one with the 123 older and one with the 30 younger POAG-related genes, which appeared before and after the phylum Chordata, respectively, or, in ophthalmological terms, before and after the evolution of the camera-type eye.\n\nNext, we have for the first time predicted in silico all 3835 candidate SNP markers in the 90-base-pair promoters of these 153 POAG-related genes.

Introduction\n\nDyslipidemia is one of the most common chronic conditions, characterized by abnormal levels of serum total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG), as well as imbalances in key lipoproteins, such as elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) []. These abnormalities are widely recognized as major risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [,]. With the rapid modernization of Korean society and the Westernization of nutrition and lifestyle trends, such as the prevalence of high-fat, high-sugar food diets, and sedentary behaviors, the incidence of dyslipidemia has significantly increased in the Korean population []. According to the Dyslipidemia Fact Sheet 2022 data, in 2020, the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia among adults aged 20 years and older in Korea continued to rise, with nearly a quarter of adults being diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia and the prevalence of dyslipidemia reaching 40.2% []. Despite this, treatment rates remain low, raising widespread public health concerns [].\n\nHigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is an acute-phase protein predominantly produced by the liver and mature adipocytes, serving as a marker for tissue damage, infection, and inflammation []. Recognized as a classical biomarker of chronic low-grade inflammation, hs-CRP is crucial in evaluating the risk of various diseases, including CVD [], cancer [], and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) []. Epidemiological evidence indicates that individuals with dyslipidemia frequently exhibit a pro-inflammatory state, characterized by elevated concentrations of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which further stimulate hs-CRP production [,]. A study focusing on a Korean cohort identified a correlation between dyslipidemia and increased hs-CRP concentrations [], highlighting the potential role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia. Nonetheless, interpreting these associations in observational studies is complicated by the presence of confounding factors and reverse causality, making it difficult to ascertain whether there is direct causation between these variables [,]. In particular, while there is a known association between hs-CRP and dyslipidemia, this relationship may be confounded by shared factors such as lifestyle or environmental influences, or it may be a consequence of the disease itself affecting hs-CRP concentrations. Thus, further research is needed to better understand their relationship and its potential implications for clinical decision-making.\n\nThe Mendelian randomization (MR) approach has emerged as a valuable method to address these limitations. MR utilizes genetic variations as instrumental variables (IVs) for exposure factors, as these genetic variations are less prone to confounding by environmental or lifestyle factors [,]. By simulating the structure of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the MR approach helps to mitigate confounding and reverse causation issues inherent in traditional observational studies []. Numerous studies have employed MR to investigate causality between modifiable exposures and major non-communicable diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD) [], T2DM [], and cancer []. However, the causality between hs-CRP and dyslipidemia has not yet been explored using MR. Thus, this study aims to investigate the causality between hs-CRP concentrations and dyslipidemia through MR analysis, offering new insights into the underlying mechanisms.\n\n\n2. Results\n\n\n2.1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics According to the Presence of Dyslipidemia\n\nThis study included 1174 participants, of whom 581 had normal lipid concentrations and 593 had been diagnosed with dyslipidemia. A comparison of the demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups is shown in . The results indicated that the average age in the dyslipidemia group was significantly higher than that in the normal group (p < 0.001), and the proportion of males was lower (p = 0.016). In terms of lifestyle factors, the proportion of alcohol drinkers was significantly lower in the dyslipidemia group (p = 0.001), but there was no significant difference in the proportion of smokers. The prevalence of prediabetes or T2DM was significantly higher in the dyslipidemia group compared to the normal group (p = 0.002).\n\nAnthropometric measurements showed that although the waist circumference in the dyslipidemia group was slightly smaller than in the normal group, this difference was not statistically significant. However, the body mass index (BMI) in the dyslipidemia group was significantly higher than that in the normal group (p = 0.032). Additionally, the two groups had no significant differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP).\n\nIn terms of metabolic indicators, insulin levels, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were all significantly higher in the dyslipidemia group compared to the normal group (p < 0.05). A comparison of lipid profiles and inflammatory markers showed that TG, TC, LDL-C, hs-CRP, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), and 8-epi-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-epi-PGF2\u03b1) were all significantly higher in the dyslipidemia group, while HDL-C was slightly lower (p = 0.033). After adjusting for confounders such as sex, age, BMI, alcohol consumption, and prediabetes or T2DM, the variables that remained statistically significant included TG, TC, LDL-C, hs-CRP, MDA, ox-LDL, and 8-epi-PGF2\u03b1 ().\n\n\n2.2. Genotype Distribution\n\nIn this study, the distribution of rs76400217 C>T genotypes among all participants was as follows: 1 individual was homozygous for the T allele (TT), 84 individuals were heterozygous (TC), and the remaining 1089 individuals were homozygous for the C allele (CC). The genotype frequencies did not significantly deviate from the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05). We combined the heterozygous (TC) and rare homozygous (TT) groups for analysis to enhance statistical power.\n\n\n2.3. Association of rs76400217 with Clinical and Metabolic Parameters\n\nTo account for potential confounding, we investigated the association of rs76400217 with common risk factors for dyslipidemia, including the presence of dyslipidemia (). The results showed that individuals with the CC genotype had the highest mean hs-CRP concentrations (1.52 \u00b1 0.10 mg/dL, n = 1089), while carriers of the T allele had lower hs-CRP concentrations (0.78 \u00b1 0.11 mg/dL, n = 85) (p < 0.001, ). However, as shown in , there were no significant differences in the prevalence of prediabetes or T2DM, or dyslipidemia between genotype groups. Additionally, no significant differences were found in other lifestyle factors, clinical characteristics, and metabolic parameters, including sex, alcohol consumption, smoking status, age, waist circumference, BMI, BP, glucose levels, lipid profiles, and oxidative stress markers.\n\n\n2.4. Association Between the hs-CRP and Dyslipidemia\n\nA two-stage least squares (2SLS) analysis assessed the causality between hs-CRP and dyslipidemia (). The results indicated that each additional risk allele of rs76400217 was significantly associated with changes in hs-CRP concentrations across all models (p < 0.001), with F-statistics ranging from 16 to 33, suggesting that rs76400217 is an effective IV for hs-CRP. However, despite the effectiveness of rs76400217 as an IV, the association between hs-CRP concentrations and dyslipidemia did not reach statistical significance in any of the models, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.44 (p = 0.267), 1.50 (p = 0.240), 1.51 (p = 0.228), 1.48 (p = 0.277), 1.49 (p = 0.264), and 1.52 (p = 0.236).\n\nThe logistic regression models examined the association between hs-CRP concentrations and dyslipidemia after adjusting for various confounding factors. In the crude model (Model 1), the OR was 2.08 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.81\u20132.39; p < 0.001), indicating a strong association. After adjusting for age and sex (Model 2), the OR slightly increased to 2.11 (95% CI: 1.83\u20132.43), and the association remained highly significant (p < 0.001). Further adjustments for alcohol consumption (Model 3), BMI (Model 4), and both alcohol consumption and BMI (Model 5) produced similar results, with ORs ranging from 2.10 to 2.11 and all p-values remaining below 0.001. In Model 6, which additionally accounted for prediabetes or T2DM, the OR remained stable at 2.09 (95% CI: 1.81\u20132.43; p < 0.001).\n\n\n3. Discussion\n\nThis research used MR to examine whether there is a causal link between hs-CRP and dyslipidemia. Through a genome-wide association study (GWAS), the SNP rs76400217 was found to be significantly associated with hs-CRP concentrations. By using this SNP as an IV, we aimed to minimize confounding effects from environmental and lifestyle factors. Although observational studies suggested a positive correlation between hs-CRP and dyslipidemia, the MR analysis did not support the direct causation between elevated hs-CRP and dyslipidemia.\n\nThe results of this study align with previous research [], which identified a significant association between elevated hs-CRP concentrations and dyslipidemia. However, the relationship between hs-CRP and dyslipidemia remains unclear. Several cross-sectional studies have shown a positive correlation between hs-CRP and lipid levels, such as TC, TG, and LDL-C, while showing a negative correlation with HDL-C [,,]. In contrast, other studies reported associations in the opposite direction [] or found no correlation at all. These inconsistencies may arise due to differences in study populations, including variations in ethnicity, lifestyle, and genetic background. Given the broad application of hs-CRP as an inflammatory marker and its ease of measurement [], further research is necessary to better understand its role in managing dyslipidemia risk.\n\nDespite the observational evidence linking hs-CRP to dyslipidemia, the MR analysis did not confirm a direct causal effect. This outcome is consistent with MR studies in other disease contexts, where observational studies have shown significant associations between CRP and diseases like cancer, CVD, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but the MR analysis failed to establish direct relationships [,,]. Moreover, MR studies on CRP and hypercholesterolemia have yielded varied results across different populations. Si et al. [] reported that genetically determined CRP concentrations were positively associated with hypercholesterolemia in the FinnGen population, while no significant effect was observed in the UK Biobank cohort. These discrepancies suggest that while CRP is associated with various diseases as a marker of inflammation, it may not be a direct driver of pathogenic mechanisms. A more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between inflammation and lipid metabolism is still needed, as highlighted in recent reviews of meta-analyses of observational studies []. As the first study to use MR to analyze the causality between hs-CRP and dyslipidemia, this research indicates that confounding factors may influence the association or that a direct causal link might not exist, with other underlying mechanisms playing a role instead. Future research should further explore this area to better understand the intricate interactions between inflammation and lipid metabolism.\n\nThe results of this study suggest that hs-CRP may function more as a risk marker for dyslipidemia rather than as a causative factor. This finding enhances our understanding of the biological interactions between hs-CRP and lipid metabolism. Both hs-CRP and dyslipidemia are well-established biomarkers for CVD and atherosclerosis [,], and research increasingly indicates that lipid levels and inflammation influence each other, contributing to disease progression. Lipids, such as cholesterol and saturated fats, can trigger inflammatory responses, while inflammation-related proteins like hs-CRP can affect lipid metabolism and arterial health []. Further investigations into these relationships could help clarify the role of these biomarkers in CVD risk assessment and inform future intervention strategies.\n\nNotably, this study identified a novel association between rs76400217 and hs-CRP concentrations in a Korean population. This discovery is particularly significant, as no prior research has examined this SNP. Rs76400217, located in the intronic region of the LOC105370802 gene [], has been linked to various phenotypes, including idiopathic scoliosis and Parkinson\u2019s disease []. Additionally, LOC105370802 has been identified as one of 16 critical genes in lung adenocarcinoma prognosis studies, highlighting its potential role in cancer progression []. Research by Lee et al. [] has shown that another SNP within LOC105370802, rs951295, is significantly associated with changes in DNA methylation levels, particularly under the influence of smoking and cadmium exposure, emphasizing its relevance in environment-related diseases. Identifying the association between rs76400217 and hs-CRP levels adds to our understanding of the role of LOC105370802 in inflammatory responses and opens up new avenues for future research. Further studies should explore the phenotypic associations of this SNP across diverse populations and investigate its potential links with other inflammatory markers, such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. If subsequent research confirms the role of rs76400217 in inflammation and metabolic diseases, this SNP could become a novel biomarker for assessing disease risk or treatment response, offering significant clinical utility.\n\nThis study does have some limitations. The sample is predominantly from the Korean population, which may limit the applicability of the findings to other ethnic groups or regions. Additionally, while MR analysis helps control for confounding variables, it cannot fully eliminate the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors. Furthermore, the use of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) guidelines from 2002 for the diagnosis of dyslipidemia may not reflect the lower thresholds recommended by more recent guidelines. While the NCEP-ATP III criteria are widely recognized and allow for comparability with previous studies, future research could consider adopting updated diagnostic standards to align with contemporary clinical practice and validate these findings in a broader context. Despite these limitations, this study is the first to report a significant association between rs76400217 and hs-CRP concentrations in the scientific literature. It is also pioneering in its investigation of the potential causality between the inflammatory marker hs-CRP and dyslipidemia. Moreover, this study minimized biases related to reverse causation and confounding by selecting a representative general population sample, excluding individuals with pre-existing conditions, and controlling for various key clinical factors. Together, these findings provide valuable insights into the complex biological pathways connecting inflammation and lipid metabolism.\n\nAnother critical point is that while this study is limited to the Korean population, it opens the door for future research to investigate the potential role of rs76400217 in other inflammation-related diseases. The identification of such genetic markers could be crucial in developing personalized therapeutic strategies for managing dyslipidemia and related conditions.\n\n\n4. Materials and Methods\n\n\n4.1. Study Population\n\nThe sample size was determined based on the estimated effect sizes from previous studies examining similar associations, along with the desired statistical power (80%) and significance level (p = 0.05). To mitigate the risk of potential dropouts and missing data, a larger initial sample was recruited than required. In this nested case\u2013control study, 1404 participants were initially assessed for eligibility. These individuals were recruited between 2014 and 2019 from the National Leading Research Laboratory of Clinical Nutrigenetics/Nutrigenomics at Yonsei University and the National Health Insurance Corporation of Ilsan Hospital in Goyang, Republic of Korea. All participants were informed about the study\u2019s objectives and provided written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hannam University (2023-04-08-0405) and adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nAfter applying exclusion criteria, which included recent diagnoses or histories of cardiovascular disease, liver disease, renal disease, pancreatitis, or cancer, regular use of medications (excluding lipid-lowering agents), and accounting for missing or incomplete data, 230 participants were excluded. The diseases were identified based on self-reports from the participants during their routine medical check-ups, using standardized hospital-provided questionnaires. As a result, 1174 participants, aged 22 to 86, were included in the final analysis. The detailed selection process is depicted in .\n\n\n4.2. Definition of Disease\n\nDyslipidemia in this study was defined under the guidelines of the NCEP-ATP III []. Participants were classified as having dyslipidemia if they met at least one of the following criteria: TG concentrations of 150 mg/dL or higher, LDL-C concentrations of 130 mg/dL or higher, HDL-C concentrations below 40 mg/dL, or TC concentrations of 200 mg/dL or higher. The diagnosis of prediabetes and T2DM was based on the criteria defined by the American Diabetes Association, which includes fasting serum glucose levels of \u2265126 mg/dL for T2DM and 100\u2013125 mg/dL for prediabetes, or HbA1c levels of \u22656.5% for T2DM and 5.7\u20136.4% for prediabetes [].\n\n\n4.3. Lifestyle and Anthropometric Assessments\n\nParticipants completed a standardized questionnaire to assess lifestyle factors. Smoking status was categorized into three groups: never-smoker, ex-smoker, and current smoker. Alcohol consumption was classified into two categories: nondrinkers and current drinkers.\n\nAnthropometric measurements, including weight, height, waist circumference, and BP, were collected following standardized procedures. BMI was calculated from the measured weight and height as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). Waist circumference was recorded at the umbilical level following normal expiration while the participant stood. BP was measured with an automatic monitor (FT-200S; Jawon Medical, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea) after a minimum rest period of 20 min.\n\n\n4.4. Biochemical Assessments\n\nVenous blood and urine samples were collected after a 12 h fast and then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C and \u221220 \u00b0C, respectively. Serum lipid levels, including TG, TC, and HDL-C, were measured using enzyme kits (Daiichi, Tokyo, Japan). LDL-C was calculated using the Friedewald formula. Fasting glucose and insulin concentrations were determined with commercial kits (Siemens, Tarrytown, NY, USA; DIAsource, Louvain la-Neuve, Belgium), and insulin resistance (IR) was calculated using HOMA-IR: [fasting insulin (\u03bcIU/mL) \u00d7 fasting glucose (mmol/L)]/22.5. Additional measurements included HbA1c by immunoturbidimetric analysis, hs-CRP with a hs-CRP-Latex kit (DenkaSeiken, Tokyo, Japan), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) using a TBARS assay kit (ZeptoMetrix Co., Buffalo, NY, USA), urinary 8-epi-PGF2\u03b1 with an ELISA kit (Oxford Biomedical Research Inc., Rochester Hills, MI, USA), and ox-LDL with an enzyme immunoassay (Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Measurements were performed with a Wallac 1420 Victor multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA, USA).\n\n\n4.5. SNP Genotyping and Selection\n\nGenotyping was carried out with the Affymetrix Axiom\u2122 KORV1.1-96 Array and Axiom\u00ae 2.0 Reagent Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Detailed procedures are described in a previous publication []. Genotype data were generated with the Korean Chip (K-CHIP).\n\nTo identify SNPs significantly associated with hs-CRP, a GWAS was conducted. Among the top ten SNPs associated considerably with hs-CRP, only rs76400217 met the stringent significance threshold (p < 10\u22128). Consequently, rs76400217 was determined to be a suitable instrumental variable for this analysis and was included in subsequent analyses to explore its role further.\n\n\n4.6. Statistical Analysis\n\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0 and RStudio v2024.04.2 software. To address the skewed distributions observed in glucose markers, lipid profiles, and oxidative stress markers, logarithmic transformations were applied. This approach normalized the data distributions, minimized the influence of outliers, and ensured the validity of statistical analyses by aligning with the assumptions of parametric tests. Independent t-tests were performed to compare continuous variables between control and dyslipidemia groups, as well as among different genotypes. Chi-square tests were used for categorical variables to assess frequency distributions. The UNIANOVA statistical method was employed to adjust for confounding variables. Logistic regression models were employed to calculate the OR with 95% CI for the association between hs-CRP and dyslipidemia. Two-tailed p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. GWAS analysis was carried out using PLINK 1.9, with linear regression analyses used to evaluate the association between genotypes and hs-CRP concentrations.\n\nThe MR analysis was conducted using a 2SLS regression approach to explore the causality between hs-CRP and dyslipidemia. In the first stage, hs-CRP was regressed using the IV. The second stage involved regressing dyslipidemia using the predicted values from the first stage.\n\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThis study is the first to identify a significant association between the SNP rs76400217 and hs-CRP. However, the MR analysis did not provide evidence for a direct causal relationship between hs-CRP and dyslipidemia risk. These findings suggest that while hs-CRP may serve as a marker of inflammation, it is unlikely to be a direct cause of dyslipidemia. This research underscores the potential role of rs76400217 as an important genetic marker in inflammation and encourages further exploration into the biological mechanisms linking hs-CRP and lipid metabolism.

Introduction\n\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) has emerged as a significant public health problem, affecting around 126 million individuals worldwide [,]. CAD is primarily caused by atherosclerosis, which results in reduced blood flow through the damaged coronary arteries to the heart muscle, leading to myocardial ischemia. Further progression of atherosclerosis and inflammation can lead to thrombosis and acute coronary syndromes (ACS).\n\nElevated levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and inflammation are established risk factors for developing atherosclerosis and ACS []. Alongside their physiological function to carry lipids to specific sites in the organism, blood plasma lipoproteins play a crucial role in the development of atherosclerosis []. Plasma lipoproteins are a combination of specific proteins and lipids, and are classified into seven classes based on their density, size, lipid composition, and apolipoproteins. Lipoproteins have various destinations and functions within the human body []. LDL-C-lowering therapies have consistently been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality. Therefore, identifying high LDL-C levels in blood plasma and managing them is common practice in preventing CAD today [].\n\nBoth genetic and lifestyle factors determine hypercholesterolemia or high blood plasma lipoprotein cholesterol level status [,,]. Mutations in four genes that encode proteins involved in the breakdown and absorption of LDL (LDLR, APOB, LDLRAP1, and PCSK9 genes) are responsible for most cases of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The LDL receptor binds explicitly to apolipoprotein B (ApoB), which surrounds the LDL particle. The LDL receptor adaptor protein, encoded by the LDLRAP1 gene, plays a significant role in transporting LDL receptors and attached LDL particles from the cell surface to the cell\u2019s interior, where LDL endocytosis occurs []. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), encoded by the PCSK9 gene, regulates the lysosomal degradation of hepatic LDL receptors, thereby modulating LDL uptake []. However, mutations of genes associated with monogenic FH are present in only about 40\u201360% of individuals with a clinical expression of FH. Known genetic factors do not explain the remaining portion []. Another significant number of patients with hypercholesterolemia who have undetected mutations may have different genes causing the condition. Some patients may have a mutation in a gene that has not yet been identified, or more likely, the condition is due to the inheritance of multiple genetic variants. Polygenic hypercholesterolemia occurs when the cumulative effect of genetic variants in multiple genes with minor LDL-C boosting properties leads to high LDL-C levels, like levels in patients with monogenic FH []. Polygenic hypercholesterolemia is diagnosed using a polygenic risk score (PRS) []. There have been 100 loci identified that influence LDL-C levels []. The more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that elevate LDL-C, the more severe the individual\u2019s hypercholesterolemia phenotype. However, specific genes associated with an LDL-C reduction may mitigate the previously mentioned adverse effects []. Overall, 80% of individuals confirmed without LDLR, APOB, LDLRAP1, or PCSK9 mutations are likely to have polygenic hypercholesterolemia []. Specialized methods to identify FH-associated gene variants are expensive or have high setup costs. In 2015, Futema et al. showed that there are primarily 6 SNPs that can help to distinguish FH patients from healthy subjects. These SNPs are CELSR2 rs629301, APOB rs1367117, ABCG8 rs6544713, LDLR rs6511720, APOE rs429358, and rs7412 []. Further studies have shown that the PRS could explain hypercholesterolemia in patients without pathogenic variants in FH-causative genes []. The PRS is a way to summarize the combined influence of multiple gene variants on a patient\u2019s phenotype []. In this pilot study, we aimed to investigate how the PRS [] may affect LDL-C levels in both healthy individuals with elevated LDL-C levels (>2.6 mmol/L) and those experiencing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\n\n\n2. Results\n\nThe age did not differ between members of the comparison group (at the time of enrolment into the study) and the patient group at the time of hospitalization (p = 0.259). See  for the characteristics of each group. There was no significant difference in the sex distribution between the groups (p = 0.625). The patients had lower LDL-C concentrations at enrolment and were more frequently past smokers and statin users. In contrast, subjects in the comparison group exhibited a higher prevalence of hypertension at the time of enrolment (p = 0.004).\n\nAll seven SNPs selected for analysis were successfully genotyped in the patient and comparison groups. The frequencies of these SNPs used in calculating the PRS are detailed in .\n\nRegarding the genetic risk, the median LDL-C SNP PRS for subjects in the comparison group was 0.674 (\u22120.176 to 0.974). In contrast, subjects in the patient group exhibited a significantly higher median LDL-C SNP score of 0.824 (\u22120.62 to 1.174), indicating a higher genetic predisposition to elevated LDL-C levels (p = 0.001). The distribution of the PRS across both groups is depicted in , where the separation between the comparison and patient groups is apparent. The regression analysis revealed that both the PRS and smoking significantly increased the odds of developing MI. Individuals with a higher PRS (odds ratio: 12.044 (95% CI: 1.551\u201393.517, p = 0.017) or smokers (odds ratio: 24.962 (95% CI: 7.171\u201386.890, p < 0.001) demonstrated markedly increased odds of experiencing MI.\n\nFurther regression analysis revealed a significant link between LDL-C levels and the PRS within the comparison group. Individuals with a higher PRS demonstrated increased odds of having an LDL-C concentration greater than 4.9 mmol/l (odds ratio: 20.391, 95% CI: 1.116\u2013358.486, p = 0.039). No significant link was found between the PRS and LDL-C levels in the patient group during hospitalization (p = 0.782).\n\n\n3. Discussion\n\nThis pilot study compared the PRS in patients with MI to individuals with elevated LDL-C levels (>2.6 mmol/L), identified through epidemiological screening. Notably, only three individuals in the comparison group experienced cardiovascular events.\n\nEpidemiological studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study, have been instrumental in understanding atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This study established traditional risk factors, including smoking, hypertension, and elevated plasma cholesterol, as key contributors to ASCVD []. Even with the effective management of these risk factors, their influence on the progression of the disease persists []. Recent findings from the Framingham Heart Study also highlight genetic variations as significant contributors to cardiovascular risk [].\n\nOur study revealed that patients were more likely to be former smokers, to have comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus or renal insufficiency, and to have a family history of CVD compared to those in the comparison group. Interestingly, individuals in the comparison group had hypertension more frequently than patients. The patients exhibited lower LDL-C concentrations than comparison group individuals, potentially due to the acute phase of MI and lipid-lowering therapy. A significant portion of patients (31.2%) were already hospitalized while on statins, whereas only 5% of subjects in the comparison group were statin users. The risk factors observed in the patient group strongly highlight the consensus that multiple elements play a significant role in the onset of cardiovascular disease [,].\n\nLDL-C values decrease significantly during the acute phase of ACS []. Fluctuations in the serum lipid profile are observed after STEMI; total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C typically decrease in the first few days following admission with STEMI [], but triglyceride levels may increase []. Post-MI statins are a cornerstone of secondary prevention, reducing major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis []. The current European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend treating ACS patients with high doses of lipid-lowering drugs []. However, individual responses to such treatments can vary significantly []. Lipid metabolism and cholesterol gene expression are altered during the acute MI phase. Lymphocytes in patients with acute MI may accumulate cholesterol inconsistently with plasma LDL-C levels, potentially influencing disease progression []. LDL-C alone may not fully represent the proatherogenic state, as specific fractions, such as small, dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C), also contribute. While we could not measure sdLDL-C in this study, prior research links sdLDL-C to the progression of coronary artery lesions []. The JUPITER trial associated sdLDL-C with coronary heart disease risk, even in patients treated with statins [], while the AIM-HIGH trial found that sdLDL-C did not predict CVD events in patients with low HDL-C and controlled LDL-C [].\n\nThis study employed a cost-effective combination of genotyping methods to calculate the PRS. HRM was selected as a reliable and economical method, allowing the multiplexing of different amplicons without needing separately labelled probes [,,]. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to use HRM to genotype SNPs linked to dyslipidemia in the context of STEMI. The present study establishes that the genetic risk of MI can be quantified by applying a PRS. This score incorporates SNPs associated with dyslipidemia identified in previous research: rs629301, rs1367117, rs429358, rs7412, rs1800562, rs11220462, and rs6511720. The rs629301 variant is a type of cadherin known as cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 2 (CELSR2). CELSR2 is an atypical cadherin in the plasma membrane and is associated with various human diseases. However, its relationship with lipid levels in blood plasma remains unclear []. Our study showed a higher prevalence of rs629301 in patients with STEMI. A study indicated an association between the CELSR2 T/T risk genotype, elevated ApoE and ApoB levels, and coronary artery stenosis extension []. The variant rs1367117 is located within the APOB gene. ApoB is a major component of lipoprotein molecules, and its variants are thought to play a role in enhancing the synthesis of LDL-C while decreasing its uptake in the liver. Maternal associations of rs1367117 have been observed with fasting glucose and insulin levels. Therefore, ApoB has shown evidence of its influence on adiposity []. The rs429358 and rs7412 are APOE variants, producing three major alleles: \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54. A study conducted on the Lithuanian population has demonstrated that these variants are associated with concentrations of LDL-C. Since ApoE interacts with LDL receptors and facilitates the clearance of chylomicron remnants and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, it plays a significant role in the normal processing of lipids []. Individuals in the comparison group of our study had a lower frequency of rs429358. The rs6511720 variant has been shown to upregulate the expression of LDLR []. The function and effects of LDLR were discussed in the Introduction section. The rs1800562 variant causes the HFE protein to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum rather than transported to the plasma membrane. It has been linked to increased levels of serum ferritin and hemochromatosis []. One study has shown that HFE likely downregulates the expression of LDLR []. The rs11220462 variant within the ST3GAL4 gene has been linked to LDL-C during GWAS studies. ST3GAL4 encodes a member of the glycosyltransferase 29 family, a group of enzymes involved in protein glycosylation. Variants in the ST3GAL4 gene have been associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, and CVD, likely by affecting liver enzyme concentrations []. However, it is unclear what functional impact this variant has. Thus, in this study, the PRS and smoking significantly increased the odds of developing MI. This aligns with evidence suggesting that a genetic predisposition to elevated LDL-C, as reflected by a higher PRS and traditional risk factors like smoking, contributes to atherosclerosis. This is consistent with the current scientific understanding [,].\n\nIn this study, higher odds of having LDL-C concentrations >4.9 mmol/L were only significant in the comparison group. This discrepancy is likely due to the acute phase of ACS experienced by subjects in the patient group at enrollment, coupled with the variable responses to treatment (for example, lipid-lowering therapy, as mentioned above, is another option to consider). A comprehensive study, SWEDEHEART, which included detailed data from 63168 statin-na\u00efve patients hospitalized with their first MI, found that high levels of LDL-C at the time of the MI are linked to a lower risk of death from all causes, but a higher risk of experiencing a non-fatal MI during follow-up. However, researchers also noted that these results could reflect a lower age at MI, fewer comorbidities, and the modifiability of LDL-C of studied patients []. The fluctuation in cholesterol levels could be explained simply as follows: the more extensive the MI damage, the more significant the decrease in cholesterol during the acute phase, as LDL-C is utilized to repair damaged tissue. This reduction could correlate with cardiac troponin T protein concentrations, as greater troponin T levels indicate a more extensive MI, while LDL-C shows a decrease [,]. Despite the limitation of a small sample size, these findings highlight the potential of the PRS to predict MI and elevated LDL-C levels when combined with other risk factors. Using preventive programs, the PRS could be a precise diagnostic tool for assessing cardiovascular risk in high-risk individuals.\n\nAnother limitation of this study is that the absence of current smokers in the STEMI group was likely due to the acute medical context of hospitalization. Smokers may have temporarily quit or reduced their smoking due to medical advice or the life-threatening nature of their condition. Moreover, smoking status data were self-reported by patients, which may indicate a desire to change their behavior following a STEMI event. This is further supported by the fact that more than half of the population reported being smokers before the event, suggesting a significant change in behavior or reporting in response to the acute health crisis. This study is also limited by including only STEMI patients, which restricts its applicability to other CAD phenotypes. The sample of healthy subjects was also limited, consisting solely of individuals with LDL-C concentrations of 2.6 mmol/L or greater. To validate and extend our findings, further research with an external validation cohort consisting of larger populations is necessary.\n\n\n4. Materials and Methods\n\n\n4.1. Patient and Comparison Group Samples\n\nThe patient group included 93 patients admitted with STEMI between January and November 2021 who underwent invasive angiography accompanied by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at the Hospital of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences in Kaunas Clinics, applying specific exclusion criteria to ensure a homogeneous patient group and minimize confounding factors (). Patients with atrial fibrillation or pericardial disease were excluded, as these conditions could interfere with the interpretation of myocardial ischemia on electrocardiograms. Patients with a history of prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were excluded due to potential alterations in coronary anatomy that could affect study outcomes. Those with significant structural heart diseases, such as valvular heart conditions, were also excluded to avoid complications related to non-STEMI-related cardiac dysfunctions. The study excluded patients with severe hepatic, oncological, or lung diseases, renal failure, or a known allergy to contrast media to prevent comorbidities that could independently increase morbidity and mortality risks. Individuals with severe dementia were excluded due to concerns about their ability to provide informed consent and comply with study protocols. Finally, patients with a positive test for COVID-19 were excluded to prevent confounding results due to the potential cardiovascular effects of the virus.\n\nFrom the International Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial Factors in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) study conducted in Kaunas, Lithuania [], 76 subjects with an LDL-C level of 2.6 mmol/L or higher were selected. They formed the comparison group for our study. From 2016 to 2024, 15 individuals in the comparison group passed away and were excluded from the study. The causes of death spanning a variety of conditions were as follows: 1 individual succumbed to complications from COVID-19, 3 individuals died from cerebrovascular ischemia, 1 from hypertension-related complications, 1 from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 1 from pulmonary heart disease, 1 from gallstone disease, 2 from different types of cancer, 1 from sepsis, and 1 from vascular dementia. A total of 61 individuals were finally included in the comparison group. Among these individuals, only two had angina pectoris. Additionally, one subject had cerebral vascular disease. The remaining participants included in the further evaluation had no history of cardiovascular disease, stroke, or diabetes. Subject inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in .\n\n\n4.2. Next Generation Sequencing\n\nGenomic DNA extraction was performed using standard laboratory procedures. The concentration of DNA was determined using a UV spectrophotometer. For library preparation, \u201cIllumina DNA prep\u201d kits (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) were used. Libraries were prepared following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols, using 200\u2013500 ng of DNA. A custom panel of Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) probes (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) enriched targeted regions. Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina \u201cMiniSeq\u201d system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing data were analyzed following the GATK best practice guidelines [].\n\n\n4.3. High-Resolution Melting Analysis\n\nA set of 7 SNPs was selected based on the study by Futema et al. to determine the patients\u2019 PRS []. APOE SNPs rs7412 and rs429358 were determined using NGS or TaqMan probes. The SNP rs6544713 (nearest gene ABCG8) was substituted with SNP rs11220462 (nearest gene ST3GAL4) and rs1800562 (nearest gene HFE) because a suitable pair of primers could not be designed for high-resolution melting (HRM)-based genotyping of rs6544713. Using primer 3, primer pairs were generated to amplify 100 bp regions surrounding the targeted SNP [,]. In cases where an adequate primer pair could not be found, the targeted region was extended. To determine primer specificity and to ensure no other SNPs were present in the amplicon, Primer-BLAST and in silico PCR tools were used [,]. Selected primer pairs were then analyzed using the Oligo analyzer tool to avoid primer secondary structures, self-dimerization, or heterodimerization []. Delta G values > \u22122 kcal/mol for secondary structures and delta G values > \u22125 kcal/mol for primer dimers were considered acceptable. Finally, the hypothetical amplicons were checked using uMELT []. HRM primer sequences are represented in . Each sample underwent two reactions: the first reaction included primers for LDLR rs6511720, APOB rs1367117, and HFE rs1800562; while the second reaction included primers for CELSR2 rs629310 and ST3GAL4 rs11220462. Genotyping was performed using the SYBR select master mix (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) on the Quantstudio 5 (ThermoFisher, USA) qPCR thermocycler. All reactions were carried out in a volume of 20 \u00b5L containing 10 \u00b5L of SYBR select master mix, 20 ng of genomic DNA primers (as specified in ), and nuclease-free water added to finalize the volume to 20 \u00b5L. Both reactions were performed in duplicate. Cycling was carried out under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min followed by 20 cycles of touchdown PCR consisting of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 59 \u00b0C for 15 s with a reduction of 0.5 \u00b0C per cycle, 72 \u00b0C for 30 s followed by 20 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 49 \u00b0C for 15 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s. Cycling was immediately followed by HRM analysis at increments of 0.1 \u00b0C ranging from 70 \u00b0C to 95 \u00b0C. HRM data were analyzed using the ThermoFisher (USA) high-resolution melt analysis tool.\n\n\n4.4. PRS Calculation\n\nThe PRS was calculated using weighted sums of the 7 genotyped SNPs based on the study by Futema et. al. [] and are provided in  and .\n\n\n4.5. Sanger Sequencing\n\nTo verify the results of HRM-based genotyping, 22 samples representing definitive genotypes were selected for sequencing. However, the set of primers for HRM analysis was designed to be as close to the variant of interest as possible. So, to carry out Sanger sequencing, a new set of primers () was designed using the previously mentioned tools. Samples were amplified single-plex using Amplitaq Gold 360 master mix (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Each reaction contained 17.5 \u00b5L of master mix, primers (10 \u00b5M each) as specified in , and 35 ng of DNA and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 35 \u00b5L. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 10 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 64 \u00b0C for 30 s with a decrease of 0.5 \u00b0C per cycle, 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, 25 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 54 \u00b0C for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, and a final extension step of 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. Amplicons were then sequenced at the \u201cTechnysium DNA Sequencing Service\u201d.\n\n\n4.6. Statistical Analysis\n\nFrequencies are shown as percentages. The non-parametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was used to evaluate quantitative clinical parameters. Fisher\u2019s exact test and Pearson \u03c72 analysis were employed to assess the proportions of categorical variables. The association between PRS and myocardial infarction (MI) and between PRS and LDL-C levels was examined utilizing multivariate regression analysis. The subjects in the comparison group were categorized into two groups based on their LDL-C levels, with those exceeding 4.9 mmol/L, suggesting a potential association with FH [,,]. All variables for the multivariate model were selected using backward selection, resulting in a final model that included only those with significance, p\u2009 < \u20090.5.\n\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe PRS can be utilized to estimate the risk of MI and to predict greater than 4.9 mmol/L LDL-C concentrations in healthy individuals. However, further research is needed to incorporate additional known risk factors and rare, high-impact genetic variants to enhance the predictive accuracy and clinical utility of PRS in assessing CVD risk."}

The objective of this study is to investigate the association between dietary iron, the SNP of the JAZF1 rs864745, and glucose metabolism among Chinese adults. Methods: 3298 participants (1584 males and 1714 females) were recruited and underwent physical measurements, laboratory tests, and genotyping. All surveys were conducted by qualified public health professionals. Dietary iron was assessed using the 3-day 24 h dietary recall method and condiment weight records. Genotyping for rs864745 was performed using the SNaPshot Multiplex System. Results: After adjusting for covariates, a significant trend was found between the dietary iron and elevated fasting glucose (p = 0.012), whereas no such trend was observed for the rs864745 (p = 0.932). Among the male participants, the risk of elevated fasting glucose was associated with both dietary iron (compared to the lowest quartile, the ORs with 95% CIs for elevated fasting glucose in Q2,Q3, and Q4 were 1.52 (1.01, 2.45), 1.73 (1.05, 3.00), and 2.49 (1.33, 4.74), respectively) and the rs864745 (OR = 2.15 (1.02, 4.51)), and an interaction effect between them was observed (p = 0.041), which was absent in females (p = 0.999 and p = 0.131, respectively). Stratified by the SNP rs864745, the males without the C allele had a linear risk increase with iron (p = 0.018), while the C allele carriers did not. Additionally, ferritin and the rs864745 were associated with the AST-to-ALT ratio (p = 0.005 and p = 0.048, respectively).

According to estimates from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the prevalence of diabetes among adults aged 20\u201379 years globally stood at 10.5% (537 million cases) in 2021 [,]. Notably, China ranks first globally in both the number of diagnosed diabetics (140 million) and those undiagnosed (72.83 million), with an alarming undiagnosed rate of 51.7%. Data from the China Chronic Disease and Risk Factors Surveillance (CCDRFS), employing the diagnostic criteria set by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), reveals that the prevalence of diabetes among adults in mainland China is 12.4%, and the prevalence of prediabetes was 38.1% [], underscoring the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe occurrence of dysglycemia is a consequence of the combined effects of genetics and the environment [], with iron playing a direct role in this abnormality []. Metabolomic studies show that high dietary iron and increased body iron stores activate inflammatory responses, contributing to insulin resistance (IR) []. Epidemiological analyses and Mendelian randomization studies have consistently demonstrated an association between these factors and the risk of elevated fasting blood and developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) []. Furthermore, there are notable sex and genotype disparities in the risk of dysglycemia arising from increased iron. Studies have consistently revealed that, compared to females, males are more prone to an elevated risk of T2D in response to increased dietary iron [,]. Moreover, individuals possessing distinct genotypes exhibit varied sensitivities to variations in dietary iron [].\n\nJAZF Zinc Finger 1 (JAZF1), a multifunctional regulatory factor located on human chromosome 7p15.2 [], serves as a pivotal modulator of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ribosome biogenesis [,]. Research has elucidated that, as a metabolic regulator, JAZF1 exerts its influence through diverse mechanisms, modulating lipid synthesis and lipolysis, thereby participating in the intricate regulation of glucose/lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses [,,]. There are numerous well-established single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of JAZF1 that have been implicated in diseases related to glucose metabolism, with rs864745 being of particular interest []. Specifically, rs864745, located at chr7:28140937 (GRCh38.p14), represents an intron variant within the JAZF1 gene and has two allelic variants: T and C. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have demonstrated that variations at the rs864745 locus are correlated with T2D across various ethnicities, including Europeans, Americans, and Asians. Notably, disparities in the risk allele and the minor allele frequency (MAF) are evident among different human races [,].\n\nDespite extensive research on IR, glucose metabolism, and the role of genes in these conditions, the proximate causes, genetic susceptibility mechanisms, and interactions between dietary iron and genetic variations remain underexplored. Dietary changes and the rs864745-C polymorphism significantly alter JAZF1 mRNA expression in the liver, impacting hepatic function and metabolism [,]. Additionally, iron excess is a known factor for liver injury []. The precise contribution of the combination of the rs864745 allele and iron to the risk of glucose metabolism remains uncertain, with a lack of evidence from the Chinese population. The objective of this study is to investigate the association between dietary iron and glucose metabolism, as well as its interaction with the rs864745 locus in the JAZF1 gene.\n\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n\n2.1. Study Population\n\nOn the basis of the Shanghai Diet and Health Survey (SDHS), between 2012 and 2013, a comprehensive random sampling approach was employed to select 4504 community-dwelling individuals aged 18 and above (consisting of 2214 males and 2290 females) from various communities across Shanghai, China. Subsequently, a household survey and blood sample collection were conducted for these participants. Participants were disqualified if they lacked anthropometric data (n = 141), had incomplete blood pressure assessments (n = 49), had uncollected or untested blood samples (n = 737), reported daily energy outside the acceptable range of 300 to 3500 kcal (n = 51), lacked dietary records (n = 33), or were missing other essential covariates (n = 145). As a result, a final cohort of 3358 eligible participants was established for this study. Notably, genotyping for the SNP rs864745 within the JAZF1 gene was performed in 3298 of these participants (1584 males and 1714 females) ().\n\n\n2.2. Dietary Assessment\n\nFood consumption data, encompassing a comprehensive range of dietary items consumed both domestically and externally, including staples, side dishes, snacks, fruits, alcoholic beverages, non-alcoholic drinks, and nutritional supplements, were meticulously gathered through the 3-day 24 h dietary recall method (spanning 1 weekend day and 2 weekdays), which was meticulously employed to offer a more accurate assessment of iron compared to food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). This rigorous data collection process was conducted by qualified public health professionals from local community healthcare centers, ensuring the validity and comprehensiveness of the dietary information. Additionally, at the beginning and end of the 3-day survey period, the weights of various primary condiments, including edible oils, salt, and monosodium glutamate (MSG), were recorded and quantified. The daily average dietary of energy and iron for each individual was precisely calculated, with the Chinese Food Composition Table serving as the authoritative reference []. It is crucial to emphasize that the iron content derived from dietary supplements was not factored into the total dietary iron calculation, given the minimal utilization of iron supplements among the Chinese population [].\n\n\n2.3. Laboratory Measurements\n\nVenous blood samples were obtained from participants by trained investigators at local community healthcare centers after an overnight 12 h fast, utilizing standardized instruments. These samples were immediately processed for various biochemical assessments. Specifically, the HITACHI 7080 Automatic Biochemical Analyzer, equipped with reagents from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), was employed to determine fasting plasma glucose (FPG), Glycated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Additionally, a Chemiluminescence Immune Detection System (ACCESS 2, Los Angeles, Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) was utilized to measure ferritin concentrations and fasting insulin concentrations. All these analyses were conducted in the laboratory of the Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the period from 2012 to 2013.\n\n\n2.4. Genotyping\n\nDuring the fieldwork conducted between 2012 and 2013, white blood cells were promptly stored at a temperature of \u221280 \u00b0C upon collection to preserve their integrity. In 2018, the DNA was extracted from these cells utilizing the magnetic bead method incorporated in the Universal Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (DP705-02, TIANGEN, Beijing, China). Subsequently, genotyping for the SNP rs864745 was carried out using the SNaPshot Multiplex System on a genetic analyzer (3730XL, Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). The resulting electropherograms were scrutinized with precision using the GeneMapper ID-X software version 4.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the genetic data obtained.\n\n\n2.5. Identification of Glucose Metabolism and Calculation of HOMA2\n\nElevated fasting glucose was characterized by a fasting glucose level of \u22656.1 mmol/L or as the state of being under glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy []. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) and the homeostasis model assessment of \u03b2-cell function (HOMA2-\u03b2) were computed utilizing the HOMA2 Calculator version 2.2.3, accessible via the website of the Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolism (www.dtu.ox.ac.uk, accessed on 20 February 2024) [].\n\n\n2.6. Potential Confounders\n\nPotential confounders were collected through an interviewer-led questionnaire that captured individuals\u2019 age, sex, body mass index (BMI), household income (determined by dividing the aggregate annual family income by the total count of family members), education level (measured in years of education), dietary energy, intentional physical exercise (designated as bodily workouts aimed at preserving wellness and physical fitness), smoking status (never, former, and current), and alcohol consumption (classified into abstainers, social drinkers, infrequent heavy drinkers, and frequent heavy drinkers).\n\n\n2.7. Statistical Analysis\n\nUsing logistic regression models to analyze the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for elevated fasting glucose, with the occurrence of elevated fasting glucose serving as the dependent variable. The independent variables included a product term comprising the presence of at least one C allele on rs864745 (a binary variable, coded as 1 for presence and 0 for absence) and the quartiles of dietary iron. After excluding 170 participants who were receiving glucose-lowering treatment, general linear regression was employed to evaluate the association between dependent variables (fasting glucose, HbA1c, and HOMA2 index, AST-to-ALT ratio) and independent variables (ferritin, dietary iron and the SNP rs864745), utilizing \u03b2 coefficients and 95% CIs. The AST/ALT ratio was analyzed as a continuous variable, with detailed evaluations conducted in 0.1-unit increments to explore its correlation with dietary iron and the SNP rs864745. All analyses were performed using RGui, version 4.3.2 (http://www.r-project.org, accessed on 15 April 2023). Statistical significance was set at a two-tailed p < 0.05. Additionally, the \u2018epiR\u2019 package was employed to assess deviations from additivity in the interaction effects.\n\n\n3. Results\n\n\n3.1. Characteristics of the Participants\n\nThe participant demographics are summarized in , encompassing a comprehensive sample of 3298 Chinese adults, comprised 1584 males (48.0%) and 1714 females (52.0%). In terms of dietary habits, the average daily iron stood at 19.3 \u00b1 15.6 mg across all participants, with a marginal variation between sex: 21.5 \u00b1 19.3 mg for males and slightly lower at 17.3 \u00b1 10.6 mg for females.  present the differences in characteristics among the four groups (Q1\u2013Q4) classified based on dietary iron intake ().\n\n\n3.2. Genotypes of the JAZF1 rs864745\n\nThe prevalence of rs864745 genotypes across the participant pool revealed a notable breakdown: 62.8% carried the TT genotype, 32.2% harbored the TC genotype, and a minority of 4.9% exhibited the CC genotype, as outlined in . Furthermore, the MAF of the C allele stood at 21.1%, which was 21.0% among the males and slightly elevated to 21.1% among the females.\n\n\n3.3. The Associations of Elevated Fasting Glucose with Dietary Iron and the JAZF1 rs864745\n\n\n3.3.1. Associations Between Dietary Iron, the\n\nAfter accounting for various factors such as age, sex, BMI, income, education, intentional physical exercise, smoking status, alcohol use, and total dietary energy, our analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between dietary iron and the risk of elevated fasting glucose levels (p = 0.012), whereas no such association was observed for the SNP rs864745 (p = 0.932) across all participants.\n\nWhen we segregated the data by sex and adjusted for the same confounding variables except sex, both dietary iron and the SNP rs864745 emerged as being linearly associated with increased risk of elevated fasting glucose, specifically among the male subjects (p = 0.006 and p = 0.047, respectively). Compared with the subgroup in the lowest quartile of dietary iron intake Q1 (<14.07 mg/day), the ORs (95% CI) for the elevated fasting glucose were 1.52 (1.01, 2.45) in the second quartile (14.07\u201317.79 mg/day), 1.73 (1.05, 3.00) in the third quartile (17.79\u201323.59 mg/day), and 2.49 (1.33, 4.74) in the highest quartile (\u226523.59 mg/day). Notably, among the males, we also identified a multiplicative interaction between the SNP rs864745 and dietary iron, suggesting a combined effect on this risk (p = 0.041). Conversely, in the female participants, neither dietary iron nor the SNP rs864745 showed any significant association with elevated fasting glucose risk (p = 0.999 and p = 0.131, respectively), and no multiplicative interaction was detected between these two factors (p = 0.302). These findings are summarized in . We also scrutinized the outcomes derived from both recessive and codominant models and concurrently conducted assessments for the HOMA2 index, elevated fasting insulin, and fasting glycated hemoglobin; both yielded negative results ().\n\n\n3.3.2. Associations Between Dietary Iron and Risk of Elevated Fasting Glucose Stratified by\n\nGiven the exclusive observation of the associations in the male participants and the significant p-value discovered in the preceding interaction analysis indicating the presence of heterogeneity within subgroups, a subsequent analysis was, thus, focused solely on the males to further stratify and investigate this heterogeneity. Within this framework, the C allele on rs864745 was designated as the risk allele. Upon adjustment for confounders such as age, income, BMI, educational years, intentional exercise routines, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and dietary energy (Model 2), a notable trend persisted between dietary iron and the risk of elevated fasting glucose among individuals devoid of the C allele (p = 0.018). Conversely, this relationship was absent in those carrying the C allele (p = 0.487). Comparing the ORs across quartiles of dietary iron against the reference group (lowest intake subgroup among non-C allele carriers), the ORs for elevated fasting glucose risk were found to be 1.66 (1.03,2.85), 2.44 (1.17,5.32), 2.13 (0.97,4.62), and 3.01 (1.31,5.79), respectively ().\n\n\n3.4. The Association of Liver Metabolic Indicators with Ferritin and the JAZF1 rs864745\n\nUsing male participant data for analysis, after adjusting for the same covariates as in previous studies except for sex, it was found that both ferritin and the SNP rs864745 were associated with the AST-to-ALT ratio (p = 0.005 and p = 0.048, respectively) ().\n\n\n4. Discussion\n\nConsistent with previous findings, our study had revealed a positive correlation between the SNP rs864745, dietary iron, and elevated fasting glucose among the male participants, whereas no significant association was observed in females. Dietary iron overload can lead to iron overload (IO) in the body. As a potent oxidant, excessive free iron had significantly promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species, thereby inducing organ-specific oxidative stress [], causing liver damage, disrupting lipid metabolism, and ultimately potentially leading to IR [,]. Research had indicated that even mild iron overload resulting from excessive iron through daily diet was a potential risk factor for both T2D and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) []. Given the fact that over one-tenth of adults in China currently suffered from IO, the rationality of appropriate dietary iron range deserves increased attention. According to the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data, the prevalence of IO was lower among females compared to males [], suggesting that the unique periodic blood loss experienced by women may serve as a protective mechanism against excessive iron accumulation in the body. This phenomenon explained why, in our study, we did not observe a significant association among the female participants.\n\nFurthermore, among the male participants, we observed that the SNP rs864745 not only exhibits a significant association with elevated fasting glucose but also interacts with dietary iron. In line with previous findings in East Asian populations, the C allele was identified as the risk allele and differs from the European population [,,]. Compared with the reference group (the subgroup with the lowest dietary iron and non-carriers of the C allele), individuals carrying the C allele exhibited a higher risk of elevated fasting glucose. A study conducted in the Chinese population had indicated that the C allele of rs864745 was associated with decreased insulin production and secretion, potentially underlying its contribution to abnormal fasting glucose levels []. We also examined the associations between fasting insulin levels, HOMA2 index, and both SNP s864745 and dietary iron, but no positive findings were observed. These results suggested the need for further extensive research into the relationship between rs864745 and insulin metabolism. Among the male participants without the C allele, a linear trend was observed between dietary iron and the risk of elevated fasting glucose, whereas no such trend was observed among carriers of the C allele. Over the past 40 years, there had been a notable decline in the proportion of plant-based foods and a remarkable increase in animal-based foods within the diets of Chinese residents, which had resulted in an elevated intake of heme iron sourced from animal-based foods []. Furthermore, the formulation of the recommended dietary iron in residents\u2019 dietary guidelines had tended to prioritize meeting the minimum requirement for dietary iron, with the potential health risks associated with excessive iron being inadequately considered or incorporated. Compared to the European population (26.3%) [], the Chinese population exhibited a significantly higher frequency of the TT (non-carriers of the C allele) genotype (62.5%), thereby emphasizing the critical necessity of regulating dietary iron, particularly among non-carriers of the C allele who are more susceptible to the impact of dietary iron and constitute the majority of the population.\n\nTo evaluate the potential relationship between liver function impairment caused by carrying the risk allele of rs864745 and body iron load, we assessed the correlation between the AST/ALT ratio, ferritin level, and the SNP rs864745. The results indicated a negative correlation between the AST/ALT ratio and ferritin level, as well as the presence of the C risk allele. The AST/ALT ratio was not only utilized in assessing hepatitis but also frequently in evaluating metabolic syndrome, serving as a pivotal indicator of liver function [,]. Notably, a decrease in the AST/ALT ratio was considered an important hallmark for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) []. Studies conducted in East Asian cohorts had demonstrated a negative correlation between the AST/ALT ratio and the incidence of T2D []. The liver bore the responsibility of handling 60\u201365% of the glucose load [], minimizing postprandial glucose fluctuations through absorption and storage of glucose, thereby playing a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of elevated fasting glucose []. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the combined effect of ferritin and the SNP rs864745 may potentially influence elevated fasting glucose by modulating liver function.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge the limitations inherent in our study. Firstly, the estimation of dietary energy and iron relied on a 3-day 24 h dietary recall method, which is subject to recall bias, potentially leading to biased estimates. This methodology inherently introduces subjectivity and may not fully capture the actual dietary patterns. Furthermore, our assessment of iron load was limited to ferritin data alone, without the inclusion of other serum markers such as free iron or transferrin. This limited scope prevented a comprehensive evaluation of the body\u2019s iron status and load. And owing to the complexity encountered during field investigations, we were unable to perform the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), resulting in the absence of 2 h insulin data. Consequently, a comprehensive assessment of insulin function and sensitivity was not feasible. Last, it is crucial to note that our analyses were conducted using data from a cross-sectional study design. As such, we were unable to draw definitive causal inferences between the SNP rs864745, dietary iron, and elevated fasting glucose. Longitudinal or interventional studies would be necessary to establish a causal relationship between these variables.\n\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nOur study found that dietary iron and the SNP rs864745 were interacted and associated with elevated fasting glucose in Chinese males, absent in females. In addition, the presence of C allele on rs864745 showed higher risks of elevated fasting glucose in Chinese male population which constantly associated with high risks whether under low or high dietary irons. The SNP and iron load might affect liver function, impacting elevated fasting glucose."}
